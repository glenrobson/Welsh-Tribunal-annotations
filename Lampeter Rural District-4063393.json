That would mean my father who is 78 years of age, and has been an invalid for years, would be left on the farm of 104 acres - with eleven horses;  and a Stallion (which I take out in season) with 38 acres of green crop and corn to set - would be left without a single male hand.

There is one horse at Pentrebach and one at Pantgwyn and the team works on both lands. We plough about 7 acres at Pentrebach and 4 acres at Pantgwyn. We have 4 cows at Pentrebach and 2 sows.\n My other son has joined the army. His father, who is a carpenter and was working in Glanmorganshire, is home at present very ill and has to undego an operation. My son is the only man I have now on whom I can rely.

About 15 acres Hay crops, the remainder of the land is used for grazing purposes. I have two teams of horses and eight other horses; Viz.- One 3 year old, two 2 year old, Three Yearlings and Two colts. I also keep an entire \"Coltman Windsor\" horse. My stock of cattle, consists,  10 milk cows, and a Bull, and 20 other head of Cattle, comprising 9 calves, a Heifer, 9 yearlings. My Stock is larger in the Winter than it is during the summer. I have 53 sheep on the farm now, and during the winter months that number is increased to about 100 sheep. I am 78 years of age, and unable to do any work owing to heart trouble, and during the Winter months am usually confined to the house. I have two sons Stephen Rees aged 30 and David Lewis Rees aged 26, and am entirely dependent on them to manage and work the farm. Their services are indispensable. David Lewis Rees acts as Shepherd and feeds the Cattle in the morning and evening assisted by my two Daughters, He also attends to and works one team of three horses and assists in other work on the farm. My son Stephen Rees owing to an accident many years ago is unable to do all/every kind of heavy work, but he is able to attend to horses and to plough. In 1914 I employed three men, including my sons, on the farm, and was able to obtain casual labour when needed. I am now dependent entirely upon my two sons. During the season, my Son, David Lewis Rees acts as \"Stallion Man\", and has done for the seasons 1914 - 1915 -1916.

Amongst those allowed to go was the present applicant: which was the means of leaving certain parts of the main roads unattended, with the result that at a meeting of the Main Roads Committee for the Southern Division, a Complaint was made by one, or more very well known, and popular member present of the BAD conditions of the roads, and a request made for the return of some if not all the roadmen.  The present applicant was one who returned to resume work on his portion of the road entrusted to him, which is sufficient evidence of the INDISPENSABILITY of this man's service,  whose mileage has already being extended.\n    It was also pointed out that Timber Haulage is carried over a portion of his road and with this heavy traffic requires a \"man on the Spot.\"\n    The Surveyor has also written to the applicant showing the need of his service as roadman and the hope that he would be allowed to remain to continue his good work.\n   Moreover, this man's family has done Yeoman Service for their Country in the present Crisis,  and have set a splendid example for others to copy, by having already send Three brothers of the applicant to uphold the honour of our Country.  He being the only son left to watch over his own family and to comfort his aged parents in their constant thoughts of those dear to them and possibly in danger.  Had we more families like this there would be no need for either Tribunal or Appeal Court.\n   The members of the Local Tribunal were Unanimous that this was a Clear Case for Conditional Exemption.\nLlew O.  Davies.\n 23/08/1916.\n <p>Decision: Temporary exemption until 30/11/ 1916 on the ground that it is expedient in the national interests that the man should instead of being employed in Military service be engaged in other work in which he is habitually engaged until the above mentioned date.\nJohn Jones, Chairman\n12/09/1916.                                  \n<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 2",

It was also stated to the Tribunal that on presenting himself for attestation under the Derby scheme at Lampeter, he was rejected by the examining officer Dr. Rowland.\nUnder the circumstances I shall be glad if you will kindly let me know what course should now be taken, as I understand that they will not examine men from Cardiganshire at Carmarthen at all, and not even at Brecon without special authority.\nYours faithfully,\nW.J.Wallis-Jones.\nEvan Evans, Esq.\nClerk to the Cardiganshire Appeal Tribunal,\nAberystwyth.<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 157M<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

About eleven years ago my Father obliged to give his business up, owing that our Pure oak bark tanning method, could not compete successfully with the foreign methods of quick tannage.\n   During that Period my Father's condition of health gave way, and sorry to say, he is by now totally unfit for any kind of work. However on seeing the Premises my Father built for the Tanning purpose going useless, also that my aged and ill healthed Parents had no means to live on.  We ventured into a considerable expense to alter these certain Premises and make them suitable to commerce Pig slaughtering and Bacon curing.

As it happens the decision arrived at was a Counterpart of Major William's remark and yet the Military think fit to appeal. \nApart of a semblance of a pre arrangement between the Military and the Members, both cases were very carefully considered when it was disclosed that here was a man carrying on a very extensive Country trade - (documents produced). Catering for a large and scattered district. One who had already been depleted of the service of Three of his past employees. (One son) at different times, but was still persevering, and the fact that he has done so well in the past proves that he does NOT in the present appeal for the retention of some help, try to discount the necessity for more soldiers, for he proved conclusively before the Tribunal that it was utterly impossible for him to carry on alone. For in addition to his shop trade he is also the Postmaster for the district with a Telegraph and Money office attached. And the person appealed against by the Military is in sole charge of the Postal Department: and to deprive the Employer of this man will seriously interfere and dislocate the postal arrangement of this (and other) districts also and I believe, gentleman, you will all agree with me that we are pretty thin skinned if any interference is attempted or caused to our Correspondence.

I do herewith enclose you the Classification Certificate.  I should feel  much obliged if you would kindly mention this fact to the Tribunal when his case will be before them on Thursday.  May I express the hope that they will consider this fact an additional reason why they should accede to the request already made in the statement sent you last week. As my establishment has already been reduced as regards the number of employees far below my real requirements, I hope the Tribunal will see their way to grant me the service of my son.  I maintain that he is doing work of national importance where he is now.\nI remain Sir,\nYours Respectfully,\nJohn Thomas.\nTo Evan Evans, Esq, County Clerk, Aberystwyth.<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 184.<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

(3) If this person is taken away, it will be impossible to carry on the business, and it will have to be closed up, thus entailing on me serious financial loss, and on my customers great inconvenience. (4) That the latter statement is true is proved by the fact that 328 of my customers have voluntarily signed a petition for the retention of the person applied for. This petition can be produced. (5) Besides my shoemaking business, I have a small farm, called Warcwm, of 16 acres, which requires a good deal of my attention. This farm was taken by me before the commencement of the war, but I entered into occupation in Oct. 1914.  I took the farm (in a lease of  99 years) for my son, David John Thomas, now in the army, because the shoemaking business did not agree with him,\n(Continued at bottom of page) \nand I am anxious to keep the farm for him till he returns. (6) I may also mention the fact that Evan Thomas underwent an operation for appendicitis about three years ago, and has never been strong since, and suffers occasional pains in the part operated upon.  A medical certificate  can be produced to confirm this; which certificate also mentions another ailment he is suffering form - psoriasis. Also, he presented himself before the Army Medical  Board at Carmarthen about a month ago,  and was placed in Class C 1.<p>Previous applications: (a) on Sept 8th. (b) By me. (c) Lampeter Local.

I understand that the Appeal Tribunal has dismissed his application, and that his time is up on the 31st Oct.  His services will not be required with his present employer next year, but I am informed that a farm servant is allowed to engage at another farm if the circumstances are similar.  I farm 60 acres of highly cultivated land.  I sow about 15 acres of corn and I have about three acres of green crop and potatoes.  I milk seven cows and I keep not less than 15 other cattle.  I have three horses in reguar work, and I generally have a few young horses.  I have about 50 sheep, seven pigs and 1 breeding sow.\nI am a widower with two daughters, the elder is 18 years of age, the other is at school.  I keep one servant girl.\nI have made every effort to get a man before military age, but I have entirely failed, and this is the only available man I can hear of free in the district. Before the war I was able to get casual labour, but this is now impossible.\nThe present boy I have is leaving me to work on the railway.  He will be of military age at the beginning of next year.  I have only been farming for nine years, before that I lived in London but on account of ill health I was obliged to come to the country to live.  I am able to do very little more than superintend and I cannot plough or do any hard work. If I cannot keep a servant man I shall be obliged to give up farming and as this man is the only one I can hear of, I trust the Tribunal will see the reasonableness of my application. My sales from the farm are far in excess of farms of its size and  if necessary I shall be pleased\n<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 187.<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I do not know whether it would not be thought that inasmuch  as the man changes his place that all the facts are new and that therefore the case might be reviewed.\nI would be very grateful if you will be so kind as to submit the matter to the Tribunal, and I would not trouble you were it not that my case is a very hard one as without a man I cannot possibly carry on my farm.\nI may point out that , although my acreage might be considered small, the farm is on the banks of the Teifi and it is all of exceptional quality, and with cultivation it is very productive.  I have given you full particulars as to my circumstances in my last letter.\nIt might give some idea as to the farm by saying that I bought it seven years ago for Â£2150.\nI am very sorry indeed to trouble you this way, but without your kind assistance I am helpless.\nYours very faithfully,\nThomas Davies\n\nEvan Evans Esq.<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 189.<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

Taxes are more than thrice what they used to be. We keep on average a stock of 55 cattle, 12 horses and about 140 sheep and lambs. We milk on an average 20 cows, this winter we got 22 cows an heifers to calve and 5 mares supposed to be in foal. We  plough every year about 40 acres of land and we have every year 45 acres under hay. Before the war broke out we used to  be 5 men on this farm, and had plenty to do, at present there are only 3 but one of whom a milk boy of nearly 17 years of age is leaving for the collieries on 13th November 1916 and I cannot get anybody to take his place, so after that date we will be only 2 men and 1 woman left to do all the work of this busy Holding and they will  be be far too little.<p>Previous applications: Two applications have been made in respect  of the man, the first in April last  and the second in August last.

My wife is 60 years of age and suffers very much from rheumatism. She is quite crippled in the right hand, so apart from being advanced in age she is thus rendered quite incapable of doing any work. I may say that the man  for whom I appeal was at the Bank for 3 years, but at the end of the year 1915, owing to my own sickness and scarcity of labour I had to get him home  to carry on the farm .  Further I may state that we supply daily in the town of Lampeter (which is 3 miles distant) 150 customers with milk, butter, cheese and potatoes, we also supply the Guardians Institution Lampeter with butter and potatoes.

That HERE is an EXCEPTIONAL Case where evidence is forthcoming that the people on this holding thoroughly realize the Crisis of this Country, and nobly respond, by doubling their energy in the production of more food for man and beast.  Ancient history tells us of a very exceptional instance in the undecided \"Wars of the Tribes\" of long ago, where the Elements in the heavens were called in to assist.  Whether this case comes under this Category is a debatable point.\nHowever we cannot shut our Eyes to the fact that this is an exceptionally well producing farm, entitling it to every possible  encouragement to retain a fair amount of labour, to continue doing the good work it has already done, & is still prepared to do.

I refer the Tribunal to the reason stated upon my previous application to the Appeal Tribunal. Since my last applications when I was granted exemption until the 31st.January my brother M.Ll.Williams has been found by Dr. Evan Evans to be suffering from Tuberculosis of the Lungs, and has been ordered to give up work altogether. I have therefore had to entirely give up my business of a sheep, cattle and pig dealer, and to purchase stock and crops at Penrallt Newydd Farm. The position therefore is that I live at Penrallt Newydd alone, and farm is without assistance of any kind. At Gwarnant there are only my mother and sister. Gwarnant is five miles distant from Penrallt Newydd, but they have to rely  entirely upon me to do the ploughing and all work which they cannot do themselves. I am therefore now the only man left to farm the two farms, and at neither farm have we any farm servants at all.<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 34  261.<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I would respectfully draw your attention to the fact that he volunteered to go to France only as a road constructor; but I find that he has been compelled to join another kind of Labour Company. May I also say that I consider that the military authorities have acted exceedingly harsh towards him, seeing that all my children, except him, have joined the forces voluntarily, and that he also volunteered as far as Road construction is concerned. I make the last remark because I understand that, at Aberystwyth, he was threatened with the police if he did not return to Brecon. I hope you can see your way clear to give him an extension of his exemption, and thus allow me to retain one son, and give directions for him to be recalled from France. <p>Previous applications: (a)  26/02/1917; (b) by present applicant (c) Cardigan County Tribunal (d) Temporary Exemption till April 1st with leave to appeal. <p>Address: Frondeg, Cribyn, Llanybyther.<p>Occupation, profession or business: Roadman.<p>Why application made by applicant for the man: As a parent, who has already given three sons to the service of his country, and who wishes to retain this one. <p>Date of application: 1917-03-27T10:22:25.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: The application be adjourned and a copy of the reasons in support of the application be furnished to the Military Representative.

We have 9 horses, 10 cows, other cattle 23, sheep 75, 2 sows + 10  store pigs.\nMy health has failed. I enclose a doctor's certificate which certifies that I suffer from Heart disease which entirely incapacitates me for any farm work but of the lightest description. I entirely depend upon my son , Saccheus, to  do the work. He does the ploughing, cutting + carting + looks after the horses. We generally break in two colts every year.  He is the only one I have to do this. He is capable of carrying on the farm as I have done, + on account of this he has taken a lot of the responsibility off my shoulders, which means a great deal in my present state of health.

About five years ago, I had two attacks of Rheumatic  Fever, and have since then been partially incapacitated from pursuing my occupation.  To cultivate the farm, I have one teamsman and a casual labourer.  The man appealed for was until about six weeks ago cowman in charge of 48 head of cattle.  About that time the health of the teamsman completely broke down, and this man now fills his place as teamsman. As the farm was already short of labour, any further depletion will render it impossible to maintain the present food production.
