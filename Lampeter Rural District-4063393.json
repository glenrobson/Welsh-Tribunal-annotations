There is one horse at Pentrebach and one at Pantgwyn and the team works on both lands. We plough about 7 acres at Pentrebach and 4 acres at Pantgwyn. We have 4 cows at Pentrebach and 2 sows.\n My other son has joined the army.

About 15 acres Hay crops, the remainder of the land is used for grazing purposes. I have two teams of horses and eight other horses; Viz.- One 3 year old, two 2 year old, Three Yearlings and Two colts. I also keep an entire \"Coltman Windsor\" horse. My stock of cattle, consists,  10 milk cows, and a Bull, and 20 other head of Cattle, comprising 9 calves, a Heifer, 9 yearlings. My Stock is larger in the Winter than it is during the summer. I have 53 sheep on the farm now, and during the winter months that number is increased to about 100 sheep. I am 78 years of age, and unable to do any work owing to heart trouble, and during the Winter months am usually confined to the house. I have two sons Stephen Rees aged 30 and David Lewis Rees aged 26, and am entirely dependent on them to manage and work the farm. Their services are indispensable. David Lewis Rees acts as Shepherd and feeds the Cattle in the morning and evening assisted by my two Daughters, He also attends to and works one team of three horses and assists in other work on the farm. My son Stephen Rees owing to an accident many years ago is unable to do all/every kind of heavy work, but he is able to attend to horses and to plough. In 1914 I employed three men, including my sons, on the farm, and was able to obtain casual labour when needed. I am now dependent entirely upon my two sons. During the season, my Son, David Lewis Rees acts as \"Stallion Man\", and has done for the seasons 1914 - 1915 -1916.

Amongst those allowed to go was the present applicant: which was the means of leaving certain parts of the main roads unattended, with the result that at a meeting of the Main Roads Committee for the Southern Division, a Complaint was made by one, or more very well known, and popular member present of the BAD conditions of the roads, and a request made for the return of some if not all the roadmen.  The present applicant was one who returned to resume work on his portion of the road entrusted to him, which is sufficient evidence of the INDISPENSABILITY of this man's service,  whose mileage has already being extended.\n    It was also pointed out that Timber Haulage is carried over a portion of his road and with this heavy traffic requires a \"man on the Spot.\"\n    The Surveyor has also written to the applicant showing the need of his service as roadman and the hope that he would be allowed to remain to continue his good work.\n   Moreover, this man's family has done Yeoman Service for their Country in the present Crisis,  and have set a splendid example for others to copy, by having already send Three brothers of the applicant to uphold the honour of our Country.

David John Thomas, Glanraven, Llanwenog.\nYou will remember that I appeared in the above case at the Appeal Tribunal at Lampeter on the 1st. inst when, owing to circumstances detailed at the hearing, the Tribunal adjourned the case to enable the man to be again examined by the Medical Board but, notwithstanding repeat applications to the Cardiganshire Recruiting Officer (Major Mathias), he has been unable to obtain permission to go before the Medical Board again, and in  letter from Major Mathias dated the 11th. ins. which is now before me, it is stated that it is not  \"admissable\" for the man to have another medical examination, as he was passed Class \"A\" by the Carmarthen Medical Board in September last and that he (Major Mathias) holds the Medical History Sheet for that examination, and has informed the Military Representative.\nYou will remember that it was stated that the man was given a \"B\" Class Card at Carmarthen, but the local Constable called about 3 days later and handed him an \"A\" Class Card signed by Major Mathias, in exchange for the one given him at Carmarthen.  It was also stated to the Tribunal that on presenting himself for attestation under the Derby scheme at Lampeter, he was rejected by the examining officer Dr. Rowland.\nUnder the circumstances I shall be glad if you will kindly let me know what course should now be taken, as I understand that they will not examine men from Cardiganshire at Carmarthen at all, and not even at Brecon without special authority.\nYours faithfully,\nW.J.Wallis-Jones.\nEvan Evans, Esq.\nClerk to the Cardiganshire Appeal Tribunal,\nAberystwyth.<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 157M<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063393/canvas/4063664.json#xywh=0,0,3428,5336",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Letter from Major Mathias relating to medical classification of David John Thomas, Abernant, Llanwenog, Cards.<p>Transcription: C.3.226.

It was decided to take both cases together, after all possible information has been obtained, and before the members of the Tribunal had considered the Evidence - \"Major Williams remarked that if one of the appeals was disallowed he would not object to the decision in the other appeal\".  As it happens the decision arrived at was a Counterpart of Major William's remark and yet the Military think fit to appeal. \nApart of a semblance of a pre arrangement between the Military and the Members, both cases were very carefully considered when it was disclosed that here was a man carrying on a very extensive Country trade - (documents produced). Catering for a large and scattered district. One who had already been depleted of the service of Three of his past employees. (One son) at different times, but was still persevering, and the fact that he has done so well in the past proves that he does NOT in the present appeal for the retention of some help, try to discount the necessity for more soldiers, for he proved conclusively before the Tribunal that it was utterly impossible for him to carry on alone. For in addition to his shop trade he is also the Postmaster for the district with a Telegraph and Money office attached. And the person appealed against by the Military is in sole charge of the Postal Department: and to deprive the Employer of this man will seriously interfere and dislocate the postal arrangement of this (and other) districts also and I believe, gentleman, you will all agree with me that we are pretty thin skinned if any interference is attempted or caused to our Correspondence. This as well as the fact that somebody must be retained to supply the public with their commodities helped us to be unanimous to grant \"Conditional\" Exemption in this case. \nLlew. O.

This farm was taken by me before the commencement of the war, but I entered into occupation in Oct. 1914.

I understand that the Appeal Tribunal has dismissed his application, and that his time is up on the 31st Oct.  His services will not be required with his present employer next year, but I am informed that a farm servant is allowed to engage at another farm if the circumstances are similar.  I farm 60 acres of highly cultivated land.  I sow about 15 acres of corn and I have about three acres of green crop and potatoes.  I milk seven cows and I keep not less than 15 other cattle.  I have three horses in reguar work, and I generally have a few young horses.  I have about 50 sheep, seven pigs and 1 breeding sow.\nI am a widower with two daughters, the elder is 18 years of age, the other is at school.  I keep one servant girl.\nI have made every effort to get a man before military age, but I have entirely failed, and this is the only available man I can hear of free in the district. Before the war I was able to get casual labour, but this is now impossible.\nThe present boy I have is leaving me to work on the railway.  He will be of military age at the beginning of next year.  I have only been farming for nine years, before that I lived in London but on account of ill health I was obliged to come to the country to live.  I am able to do very little more than superintend and I cannot plough or do any hard work. If I cannot keep a servant man I shall be obliged to give up farming and as this man is the only one I can hear of, I trust the Tribunal will see the reasonableness of my application.

That HERE is an EXCEPTIONAL Case where evidence is forthcoming that the people on this holding thoroughly realize the Crisis of this Country, and nobly respond, by doubling their energy in the production of more food for man and beast.

I refer the Tribunal to the reason stated upon my previous application to the Appeal Tribunal. Since my last applications when I was granted exemption until the 31st.January my brother M.Ll.Williams has been found by Dr. Evan Evans to be suffering from Tuberculosis of the Lungs, and has been ordered to give up work altogether. I have therefore had to entirely give up my business of a sheep, cattle and pig dealer, and to purchase stock and crops at Penrallt Newydd Farm. The position therefore is that I live at Penrallt Newydd alone, and farm is without assistance of any kind. At Gwarnant there are only my mother and sister. Gwarnant is five miles distant from Penrallt Newydd, but they have to rely  entirely upon me to do the ploughing and all work which they cannot do themselves. I am therefore now the only man left to farm the two farms, and at neither farm have we any farm servants at all.<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 34  261.<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063393/canvas/4063892.json#xywh=0,0,3616,5496",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Lampeter Rural District<p>Number of Case: 262.   34.    122.<p>Name: David Mordecae Williams.<p>Age: 31.<p>Date of birth: 1885-02-14T10:35:15.000Z<p>Married or single: Single.<p>Address: Pantralltnewydd, Llanybyther.<p>Address at date of National Registration: Gwarnant, Llanybyther.<p>Where attested: Lampeter.<p>Occupation, profession or business: Farmer.<p>Precise occupation before 15 August 1915: Always been employed in farming. <p>Grounds: (a) (d) & (e).<p>Nature of application: Conditional Exemption .<p>Tag: Blue R52/53, page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063393/canvas/4063893.json#xywh=0,0,3608,5464",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reasons in support of the application: See grounds annexed .<p>Signature: David Mordecai Williams.<p>Date: 1917-01-30T10:45:57.000Z<p>Decision of Tribunal: That the man be exempted from being called up for military service.

I would respectfully draw your attention to the fact that he volunteered to go to France only as a road constructor; but I find that he has been compelled to join another kind of Labour Company. May I also say that I consider that the military authorities have acted exceedingly harsh towards him, seeing that all my children, except him, have joined the forces voluntarily, and that he also volunteered as far as Road construction is concerned. I make the last remark because I understand that, at Aberystwyth, he was threatened with the police if he did not return to Brecon. I hope you can see your way clear to give him an extension of his exemption, and thus allow me to retain one son, and give directions for him to be recalled from France. <p>Previous applications: (a)  26/02/1917; (b) by present applicant (c) Cardigan County Tribunal (d) Temporary Exemption till April 1st with leave to appeal. <p>Address: Frondeg, Cribyn, Llanybyther.<p>Occupation, profession or business: Roadman.<p>Why application made by applicant for the man: As a parent, who has already given three sons to the service of his country, and who wishes to retain this one. <p>Date of application: 1917-03-27T10:22:25.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: The application be adjourned and a copy of the reasons in support of the application be furnished to the Military Representative.

About five years ago, I had two attacks of Rheumatic  Fever, and have since then been partially incapacitated from pursuing my occupation.  To cultivate the farm, I have one teamsman and a casual labourer.  The man appealed for was until about six weeks ago cowman in charge of 48 head of cattle.  About that time the health of the teamsman completely broke down, and this man now fills his place as teamsman. As the farm was already short of labour, any further depletion will render it impossible to maintain the present food production.
