I have been in business as Plumber in Cardigan for the last twelve years. A business which I have built up by my own personal work & attention, so it is obvious that in my absence, I could not obtain a substitute to carry it on. I have worked hard for twelve years to obtain this connection so in the event of me having to take on Army Service. When I would return I should naturally have lost all the connection which is the fruit of many years hard application I estimate at present my stock & tools to be worth at least £30 a stock I can only dispose of by my own labour. As every business man I have also liabilities to meet and debts to collect. I am a married man with a wife & three children solely dependent on me for their living. One of my children suffering periodically from convulsions requiring both my wife & selfs constant care & attention. Here I beg to quote Mr Walter Long's statement that in his instructions to the Tribunals that a head of a small business with three or more dependents upon them was to secure the most lenient consideration. I argue that the decision of the Local Tribunal is far from showing such leniency in my case. My work to a great extent is of national importance inasmuch that it is chiefly in connection with agricultural work such as repairs to pumps & maintenance of water supplies. Apart from this I am in a public service as Captain of the local fire brigade. <p>Signature of appellant: D. J. Thomas <p>Date: 1916-06-29T09:50:46.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

I am conscious ot the trouble I have given you.   \nI received your letter of Tuesday safely. I am surprised at Major Williams denying that he had made arrangements with me that I should see Col. Brewer the officer in charge of the substitution scheme in view of obtaining work on a farm in the district. He said it publicly at the tribunalat N. C.

My legs can never stand the strain as the pain would be intolerable.

Therefore I appeal to you for an exemption with further right to appeal so that I may have an opportunity of treating the complaint to the best advantage, I have been partially disabled for the last 14 weeks and have not received one penny compensation during the whole time, so you may realise that it is not a very pleasant position to be in especially when the cost of living is so extortionate. I relinquished a good position which I was doing exceptionally well to go to the Ammunition Works, but I feel certain that my late employers would only be glad to reinstate  me providing that you will grant according to my requst, I will then have an opportunity of earning little towards the maintenance of my wife and child.

[in margin written:   Certificate 1 G. Davies E.   Certificate 2.  G R Davies]\nIn addition to statement already sent in I beg to state that I am, for over 2 years, quite unable, personally, to do any heavy work on the farm owing to my periodically being laid up with passing of Gall Stones. My son Geo. Richard Davies does all the ploughing, sowing, thatching & in fact I am entirely dependent upon him in these respects as my second son, Shadrach John Davies is certified as physical weak. My wife also is far from being well and incapable of farm work as she used to be. Certificates (medical) as to the state of my health, that of my wife and second son are handed in, in verification of my statements.  If I only could do without the services of my said son George R Davies, I would readily make the sacrifice for our King & Country, but I consider and humbly claim that he will be helping me to contribute  my part in trying to cope with the serious question of victualizing the nation.\n  I am prepared to answer any & all questions put to me.\n<p>Name of Tribunal: Sir Aberteifi<p>Number of Case: 255<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

It was formerly carried on by my father, and at outbreak of war he had two assistants beside myself in the business. One has since joined the army and the other opened business for himself. My father has since died leaving myself in charge. My widowed mother is in very indifferent health and is under the care of the Doctor and is quite unfit to be left alone. She depends mainly upon me for her support as her only child. The capital in stock & premises is large. Also I have a large optical business and I am the only optician's mechanic in the town doing work for the trade as well as the public. I also have a tremendous repairing business in watches, clocks, instruments & the engraver to nearly all the undertakers within a radius of 10 miles. I have more work than I can possibly manage.
