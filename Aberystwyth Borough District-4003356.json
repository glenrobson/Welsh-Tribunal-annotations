In my individual capacity I am quite prepared to give Queens, comfort or inspiration to whomever stands in need of it and to alleviate pain and suffering if the opportunity arises. This is in its very essence a Christian work. However, under no circumstances can I submit myself to military control & become part of the military organisation. Any such action of mine would deprive me of any power of initiative and individuality and would simply make me a part of the military machine.

As I stated to them , I cannot participate in any act of war nor can i either take the military oath or allow it to be assumed that I have taken it. \nIn my individual capacity, I am quite prepared to give comfort and inspiration to those in need of it and alleviate pain and suffering wherever the opportunity is given. This is, undoubtedly a Christlike work. But even for this work I cannot submit myself to military control and become part of military organisation, because this would take away from me all initiative and individuality and simply make me part of a machine. My conscience forbids me to give absolute and unconditional allegiance to any except God Himself. Thus,  not b exempt me from all military service does not meet the claims of my conscience, and I find it impossible to enter the R.A.M.C.\nAnother important matter that has been overlooked is my present work in College. I am now in the very middle of my College Career and am pursuing an Honours Course in History. Moreover, I realise that my call in life is to minister to the spiritual + religious needs of men. God has called me to the Highest task, to which it is possible to call a man. Is it reasonable to refuse me the right to prepare myself for the Christian ministry, a work undoubtedly of supreme national importance? Moreover I am even now actively engaged in religious work both in <p>Signature of appellant: William James <p>Date: 1916-02-26T10:04:59.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003377.json#xywh=0,0,3548,5548",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 8<p>Name: Lewis, William James<p>Address: Aubrey House, Queens Road, Aberystwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: Ministerial Student<p>Attested or not attested: Not attested<p>Grounds: Continued from page attached to the form...... college and outside. My claim is therefore, that I be exempted from all military service on condition that I be engaged in work of national importance and the work that I feel most adapted for and definitely called to is the work of Christian Ministry. If witnesses are needed to prove the absolute sincerity of these convictions, which I have but very imperfectly expressed, since  I cannot express them too strongly, they are forthcoming. I ask if it is essential in the national interest that ministers should be exempted is it not just as necessary that those who are in active preparation for such ministry should merit exemption too. The importance of my present work seems to have had but little consideration by the Local Tribunal and the nature of my objection was completely misunderstood. I felt that the only logical stand I can take as a conscientious objector is one for total (underlined) exemption for all (underlined) military service. Any act of war is, to my mind, definitely antagonistic to the whole spirit of Christ's teaching, as we find it in the New Testament.<p>Signature of appellant: William James Lewis<p>Date: 1916-02-26T11:40:43.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003378.json#xywh=0,0,3552,5536",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reason for decision of Local Tribunal: Conditional Exemption granted on grounds of (c) and (f).

(1) I am convinced that the Local Tribunal either misunderstood or deliberately disregarded my position as a conscientious objector to military service. In my appeal I thought I made it quite clear that I am not willing to take the military oath or allow it to be assumed that I have taken it since absolute allegiance to two different persons is impossible. I shall not partake in any work which is under military control and which is a deliberate act of war. My objections is not based on any political creed but on deep religious convictions. It is my deep rooted conception of the obedience I owe to no earthly (king) master, but to the King of Kings and to the Prince of Peace. Secondly, my work in preparing for the education of the rising generation is of the utmost importance. As one famous author says \"Teachers touch the soul of the future\" and so have the most to do in the moulding of the character of future citizens of Britain. This claim was ignored as the exemption certificate shows that the only ground taken into consideration was (f) the conscience clause. Therefore as a conscientious objector and being prepared for the teaching of the young, a work essentially of national importance, I think I am entitled to exemption.<p>Signature of appellant: Gwilym Edward Thomas<p>Date: 1916-03-06T12:11:48.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003382.json#xywh=0,0,3576,5536",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reason for decision of Local Tribunal: Conditional Exemption granted on ground (f).

At a time when conflicting views are strongly held, allow me to assure you of my implicit belief in the sincerity with which you maintain a conscientious objection to army duty.  I have know you long enough to feel positively certain that your attitude, in reference to the demand made upon you, is the outcome of your honest and sincere conviction as to the course you ought to take.

Evan Evans Esq. Secretary of the Cardiganshire Appeal Tribunal.  Dear Sir, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your notice that my appeal will be further considered at (deleted) next Friday June 2nd. In connection therewith I enclose a copy of a letter that I have received this morning from the Committee on work of National Importance from which I gather that the tribunal has communicated with them regarding my case. May I ask whether you are at liberty to inform me whether the tribunal has already decided to refer my case to the Pelham Committee, or whether it wishes finally consider my case next Friday. If they have decided to refer me to the committee, do you think they would be prepared to dispense with my appearance before them next Friday. I only suggest this as it seems possible that they may wish to refer any further evidence to the committee; but if they have any desire that I should attend I am quite prepared to do so, though my absence from the school for two or three days would cause some inconvenience. With regard to the enclosed I would like to point out that, I am at present engaged in teaching mathematics and science here, that I am a considerable distance from my home (Cardiff), and that I have accepted the post since sending in my appeal. I would be much obliged to you if you could let me have advice by wire as to whether I had better appear before the tribunal or not. I enclose a stamped form. In order to arrive in time I think I wold have to leave here on Thursday morning.

Dated 27 May 1916 addressed to Mr Arthur Edward Williams, Ackworth School, Pontefract. Yorks.<p>Transcription: Dear Sir, Your application for assistance in obtaining work of national importance as the condition of your exemption from military service has been considered by the committee, but I am directed to inform you that without a personal interview they find it difficult to recommend work which you would be qualified to undertake. The committee would suggest for your consideration that you might take up work for the Y.M.C.A. or some teaching post. You will probably be able to communicate with some Education Authority on the subject. Failing this the committee could only recommend your employment on a farm or market garden where labour is really needed. In any case it is a stipulation of the Committee that the work must be at some distance, say over 20 miles from home, and it is necessary whatever work you undertake that you obtain and forward to the Committee a letter from your employer stating that he is willing to engage you, the nature of the work, and the remuneration.

I work for a very wide agricultural district and the nearest forge to mine on the Aberayron road is nearly five miles away, and on the Llanbadern side also the nearest forge is 5 miles away.\nMy customers are drawn almost exclusively from the farms class, and I make a speciality of the making and repairing of agricultural implements. Before the outbreak of war I had two men and one apprentice in my employ. One man, David William Jones, joined the forces in August 1914 and since then I have had to carry on the forge with the aid of my son, Evan Thomas Jones, and an inexperience apprentice, as I have been unable to replace the said David William Jones. I am 55 years of age as  as my health is not what it was, I have had to rely for the past 5 years upon my son, Evan James Thomas, to do the heavy work for me, especially to the shoeing of restive horses. I have entered into a contract for the weekly supply of 50 pairs of horseshoes for the Government and if I am deprived of the services of my son, I shall have to cancel this contract and in all probability, I shall have to close the forge, which will entail special hardship to me, as I depend upon it for my living, and also to the neighbouring farming community, as my son is indispensable to my business. I also claim exemption for my son on the ground that he is engaged in a reserved occupation. <p>Signature of appellant: Evan Thomas<p>Address of appellant: Asfryn, South Gate, Aberystwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: Blacksmith, Shoeing and Agricultural Implement Maker<p>Date: 1916-03-18T10:57:30.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003410.json#xywh=0,0,3584,5544",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reason for decision of Local Tribunal: It is not necessary in the national interests that he should continue in civil employment.\nMAR 21 1916\nJohn Evans\nChairman<p>Decision: Appeal dismissed.\nJohn Jones\nChairman\n14/4/16<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 2",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003411.json#xywh=0,0,3500,5460",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: A77<p>Name: Evan James Thomas<p>Age: 27<p>Address: Arfryn, South Gate, Aberystwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: Blacksmith, Shoeing Smith, & Agricultural Implement maker<p>Address of place of employment:  Arfryn, South Gate<p>Name of employer: Evan Thomas (Father)<p>Address: Arfryn, South Gate<p>Business: Blacksmith, Shoeing Smith, & Agricultural Implement Maker<p>Nature of application: Absolute exemption<p>Grounds: (a), (e) & (d)<p>Tag: Beige R186/187, page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003412.json#xywh=0,0,3488,5512",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reasons in support of the application: He being the only son working with me at Piccadilly Forge South Gate Aberystwyth.

Apart from his domestic position, Mrs Myers' health, he is at present employed in work which is of great importance to the carrying on of the old Established business, Wheatley & Sons, Pianoforte Dealers, Tuners and Repairers and has been with the firm for the past seven years (four and a half years with my late father, who died in 1913 and for the last two and a half years with me - W H Wheatley) in helping to continue in the business and to carry out important obligations to the estate, chiefly in Pianoforte tuning etc., the greater part being annual contracts with churches, chapels (schools, private and council) within a radius of 50 miles of Aberystwyth. I beg of you, gentlemen, in consideration of Mr Myers and the Business' exceptional circumstances to grant Mr Myers exemption from immediate service with the Army and to give him as long a time as you possibly can. As if I have to part with Mr Myers' valued services it will not only mean great hardship, but would spell ruin to my business connections and also affect the majority of musical people in Mid-Wales. We have at present a deal of repairs in hand at the workshop, which it is important that Mr Myers completes and our own stock to prepare for the Summer Season.   Entertainments and the band, also are looking forward to the National Eisteddfodd being held this year at Aberystwyth.

Darkgate St.,\nAberystwyth\n\nDear Sir,\nCardigan Appeal Tribunal : 7th July 1916\nre David Thomas: No.4 on list.\n\nI am acting on behalf of Mr E. E Jenkins, builder, of Aberystwyth, who applied for exemption in regard to the above-named David Thomas before the Aberystwyth Borough Tribunal. Mr Jenkins has in his employ another Stonemason, vizi-Arthur Corfield, a single man, who was rejected under the Derby Scheme, and I have had an interview today with Major Williams, the Military Representative, with reference to the military appeal lodged against David Thomas, and Major Williams has agreed that the case shall stand over until the next Appeal Tribunal to be held for the hearing of appeals from the Aberystwyth Borough so as to enable Arthur Corfield to be again medically examined in the meantime so as to ascertain whether he is now fit for military duties, inasmuch as he is a single man whilst David Thomas is a married man with a large family. I shall accordingly be much obliged if you will kindly arrange for the case to stand over at the Appeal Tribunal tomorrow, at which in the circumstances I shall not attend, and Major Williams has requested me to ask you not to reinstate David Thomas' case in the list  until you receive a further communication from him.\n\nYours truly\n\nD Emrys Williams\n<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 35<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003541.json#xywh=0,0,3548,5508",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 35<p>Name: David Thomas<p>Address: Rhydyfelin, Abersytwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: Stonemason<p>Attested or not attested: not attested<p>Grounds: That it is no longer necessary in the national interest that he should continue in civil employment.<p>Signature of appellant: T H.

In the first instance, the dentist was granted merely a short postponement by the  Local Tribunal; he appealed against this decision to the Appeal Tribunal, who, while declining to alter the decision, granted leave to appeal to the Central Tribunal. The Solicitors of the Association were instructed to endeavour to obtain permission for the Council to appear before the Central Tribunal on his behalf.  This permission, however, was not granted and only a written appeal was allowed.  A statement was accordingly drawn up on general principles in order that an appeal might be considered in the light of a test case, and the Association offered to depute one of its members to attend before the Tribunal to discuss the matter. This lead to an interview with the Executive Committee on June 2nd.  The committee discussed the whole problem with the Central Tribunal from the point of view of National Interests and Public Health and also hardships of individual dentists.\nThe appeal in the case referred to was allowed, and the dentist was granted exemption conditional upon his remaining in his present occupation, and the following important addition was appended to the decision :- \n\"The Central tribunal from evidence submitted to them are impressed with the danger of further reducing the number of registered dentists now in the country.  Whether nay particular dentist should be granted exemption must obviously depend to some extent upon the requirements of the place in which he practices, but they are inclined to think that unless it be shown that his services are not required he should be granted an exemption. Similar considerations apply to the mechanics on whom dentists depend for the efficient performance of their work.\"\nI trust that this pronouncement, coming as it does, from the Central tribunal, will be assistance to those who may be appealing for exemption, either on their own behalf of for their mechanics.\nYours sincerely\nFrank J.

I have one daughter (an invalide) being home nearly 12 months, being now in Cardiff Hospital under treatment, also a daughter at home suffering from the effects of Rheumatic Fever. I have speculated all in the business so it would mean selling up the business, also it would ensure serious hardship if my son should go. I object to all questions raised in English. \nYours faithfully\nDaniel Hughes<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: A260<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003683.json#xywh=0,0,3552,5508",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: A75 and A260<p>Name: Jenkin David Hughes<p>Age: 20<p>Address: 3 Rheidol View, Panparke<p>Where attested: Aberystwyth<p>Number of group: 3<p>Occupation, profession or business: Bread Baker<p>Name of employer: Daniel Hughes<p>Address: 3 Rheidol View, Panparke<p>Business: Grocer + Baker<p>Grounds: See para 5<p>Nature of application: Withdrawal in variation of exemption<p>Tag: Blue R52/53, page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003684.json#xywh=0,0,3552,5508",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reasons in support of the application: Not in the national interests that this man should remain any longer in civil employment<p>Signature: J R Williams Capt<p>Address: Drill Hall Aberystwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: M.R<p>Date: 1916-09-09T14:03:37.000Z<p>Decision of Tribunal: That the conditional exemption previously granted be continued. \nSEP 15 1916\nJohn Evans \nChariman<p>Tag: Blue R52/53, page 2",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003685.json#xywh=0,0,3592,5508",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: A75<p>Name: Jenkin D.

I trust everything to him, and when called away on business, I leave him in full charge of the premises, it has taken me years to teach him and were he taken away from me, it will entail great hardship to me.\nI also do a large business in the glass & earthenware trade, all of which goods<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 73<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003722.json#xywh=0,0,2904,4132",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Page 2 of letter from Robert McIlquham appealing the case of his assistant D.J.G.

The result is that I have had the greatest difficulty in keeping the whole of the garden under cultivation. \nThis man is absolutely indispensable if I am to keep the gardens going and to continue to produce foodstuffs on my usual scale. It will mean serious loss financially to me if I lose this man as all my cpaital[sic] is sunk in the gardens and it is quite impossible to procure a qualified gardener at the present time. \nI claim that I am entitled to any case to keep this man until the 1st January next in view of the latest Regulations to Tribunals and on that ground alone I appeal to the Tribunal to dismiss the militaryxx appeal. I put in for the Tribunal to read a report of a test/ case on market gardeners decided by the Worthing Tribunal at the end of last month, and this case is on all fours with my case. \n[handwriting] Page 308. <p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4003728.json#xywh=0,0,3592,5564",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 71<p>Name: Albert James Williams<p>Age: 31<p>Address: 2 Gogerddan Cottages, Aberystwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: Market Gardener - only man left on 2 acres land + 8 glass houses, all food production for town & neighbourhood.<p>Name of present employer: Mr. J.

A very large number of prescription are dispensed at my stores both for private persons and under the National Health Insurance Act, and in view of the shortage of staff at the stores, he is indispensable to the carrying on of the business as he is a very highly trained and efficient apprentice owing to his long experience in the trade. <p>Previous applications: By me to the Aberystwyth Borough Tribunal when conditional exemption was granted which exemption was varied on the 29th Sept. 1916 by the Appeal Tribunal to 6 months open exemption.<p>Signature: B Taylor lloyd<p>Date of application: 1917-03-06T15:37:35.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: That the man be exempted from the provisions of the Military Service Act 1916.

If replaced by a woman, efficiency of school would suffer as a female would have great difficulty with the discipline on account of the nature of school.\n2. H.M.Inspector verbal report at his last visit (Mar 10th). The work of he school had reached a very high standard.  It would be a great hardship on present headteacher if called away after such good work. ( I was told to mention this to the Manager in any case).\n3. Mrs Thomas after a very serious operation which she had to undergo last January has not yet fully recovered.\nI remain\nYours faithfully\nT. Ll.

I was a member of the Official Training Corps at U. C. W. but in December 1915 was obliged to resign on account of physical unfitness. I was recently examined by the Medical Board at Carmarthen and rejected for all forms of military service except clerical work abroad. I am a Research Student at the Univ College of Wales and am being trained for the work of teaching Economics, a subject which must occupy an important place in education after the war. The specific research work on which I am at present engaged consists in the investigation of the effects of the war on wages and prices; on the movement of labour; on the employment of women and on industrial conditions generally. I submit, that since the only work of military value that I can be called upon to undertake is clerical work, it is expedient that I should continue such research, the results of which I hope will be of national value. \nFor the above reasons I beg to apply for exemption conditional upon my continuing my present work.<p>Signature: Illtyd David<p>Date of application: 1916-08-21T11:39:52.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: Exempted on condition that and so long as he continues to carry on his present research work.

I should be much obliged if you would permit me to make the following statement with reference to the facts giving rise to the Appeal.\nDuring the vacation I received a notice calling me up for medical reexamination. About the same time my attention was drawn to the following cutting from \"The Times\" of July 13th 1917. \n\"CERTIFIED EXEMPTIONS\nNOT LIABLE FOR RE-EXAMINATION\nAt the House of Commons Appeal Tribunal yesterday Mr. D. Maclean, M.P., stated that after consultation with the authorities he was authorised to confirm his previous statement that a man holding a valid certificate of exemption under the Military Service Act, 1916, was not liable to be called up by the Army authorities for medical re-examination during the currency of his certificate, except in the case of a man who has never been examined and classified by an Army Medical Board. \nThe same principle applied to an attested man in similar circumstances, the intention having been frequently expressed that an attested man was not to be placed at a disadvantage as compared with a non-attested man. There were some cases where a man had been rejected and held a certificate of exemption but was liable for re-examination, but on classification for any form of military service he started with fresh tribunal rights\"\nAs I held a Tribunal Exemption Certificate and had already been examined by a Medical Board (class B 3) I already fell within the lines of Mr Maclean's statement. I accordingly wrote to the Barry Recruiting Officer and pointed out that I was not liable to reexamination during the currency of my certificate. \nIn view of my low Medical category, and the further evidence\nPTO<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 189<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4004102.json#xywh=0,0,2856,3720",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Page 2 of a letter from Illtyd David to to the Chairman of the Cardiganshire Appeal Tribunal regarding the application for the withdrawal of his exemption certificate, and the notice calling him for Medical re-examination<p>Transcription: of the permanent character of my disablement, which I laid before the Local Tribunal, I submit that there are no grounds for further examination, still less for the variation or withdrawal of my exemption certificate.

Since the outbreak of war I have been totally rejected on four ocasions (No 11th 1914; July 10th 1915; Nov 22nd 1915 and January 17th 1916) I served in the Officers Training Corps for some time but was then discharged on account of my physical unfitness. On each occasion the chief cause of my rejection was on permanent injury to the leg. On examination by a Medial Board I was classified as fit only for clerical work (B3). In view of the permanent character of the disablement as further testified by the attached medical certificate, there seems no ground for further examination\n2. As I am in Class B3, I come under the Bd of Education Agreement with the War Office whereby all students under class B1 came to be exempted from service\n3. I am being educated for the work of teaching and I am at present engaged in research work on industrial conditions - work which is of the highest importance at the present time. I propose going up to Cambridge next season and as I have already become a student of that University paid my fees it would be a serious financial loss if I was not allowed to proceed there.\nYours very truly\nIlltyd Davies\n*Carmarthen Medical Bd<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 189<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4004106.json#xywh=0,0,3304,5056",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Letter from Mr Roberts to the Clerk of the Aberystwyth Tribunal regarding Illtyd Davies' case at the meeting of the next Tribunal<p>Transcription: University College of Wales, Aberystwyth September 27th, 1917.\nTo the Clerk\nof the Aberystwyth Tribunal.\nDear Sir,\nMr Illtyd David having informed me that his case is to come before the next meeting of the Tribunal I beg leave to submit the following statement in reference to his position.\nMr David has studied in this College for four years and is a graduate of the University of Wales with first class Honours in Economics.

If I am called up for service, serious hardship will ensue to me and my family and my partner as I am now in sole charge of the business which depends entirely upon my personal services for its continuation and for the completion of the contract entered into.<p>Previous applications: By myself to the Aberyswyth Borough Tribunal on the 9th day of June 1916 when temporary exemption was granted until the 9th day of October 1916<p>Signature: Thomas Samuel<p>Date of application: 1916-09-28T10:36:19.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: Exemted till 20th January 1917, the exemption not to be open to renewal or variation except unpon an application made with the leave of the Tribunal\nGround (d)\nOCT 20 1916\nJohn Evans \nChairman<p>Tag: Beige R41/42: Page 2",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4004125.json#xywh=0,0,3548,4568",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Letter of support for application for exemption  for Mr Thomas Samuel by J.E.Williams<p>Transcription: October 11th 1916\nFrom J.E.Williams,\nBUILDER AND CONTRACTOR\n3 ST ALBAN'S VILLAS\nBORTH\nMr J Evans\nClerk to the Borough Tribunal\nTown Hall\nAberystwyth\nDear Sir,\nI beg to support the application of Mr Thomas Samuel Plasterer to your Tribunal for Exemption.\nMr Samuel's tender for cementing and plastering two houses which I am building in Borth has been accepted by me, and he has already begun the work which will take him at least six months to finish, and if he fails to carry out the work a serious loss will fall upon me in my Contract as it is impossible to find labour at the present time\nYours faithfully\nJ.E.Williams <p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 77<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4004126.json#xywh=0,0,3552,5512",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 96<p>Name: Thomas Samuel<p>Age: 39<p>Married or single: Married<p>Address: 19 Chalybeate Street, Aberystwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: Master Plasterer<p>Precise occupation before 15 August 1915: Master Plasterer <p>Length of occupation before 15 August 1915: Years<p>Grounds: (a) + (d) <p>Nature of application: Temporary exemption for 4 months <p>Tag: Beige R41/42: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4004127.json#xywh=0,0,3560,5472",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reasons: I am a master Plasterer carrying on business in partnership with William H.

In the early stages of the War, however, we encouraged recruiting and lost a very large percentage of our employees, and in fact our staff is now depleted to such a point that we really cannot lose the services of one further man without jeopardizing our output.\n\nIn accordance with the request of the Board of Agriculture last Spring, we have raised larger stocks than usual for distribution during the coming Spring months, and if we are to lose the services of our distributors, farmers having been used <p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4003356/canvas/4004310.json#xywh=0,0,3312,5216",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Gartons Ltd, Warrington\n18 March 1918\nThe Chairman & Members of the Borough Tribunal, Town Hall, Aberystwyth\nRe.

My work with the YMCA was extremely hard, sometimes I worked fro 12 + 13 hours a day. The result was a break down in health which necessitated my taking a few weeks rest. Immediately on the first signs of recovery I took on YMCA work and continued up to Oct of last year, when in view of my health, and the fact that my category was CI I returned to Aberystwyth College. I have just completed a session of hard work and  am preparing for an important exam for next year. If my educational courses were again interrupted the results would be ruinous. Am quite prepared if necessary to offer my services in any capacity which would allow me the best margin to keep in touch with my course and be engaged in the work of pursuing my studies.I have 7 years experience of colliery work.

Please quote our reference. AGP/CH. GEORGE ANDERSON & ANDERSONS. COLLIERY PROPRIETORS. TIMBER MERCHANTS. TELEGRAMS: \"YEDDA PHONE, LONDON.\" TELEPHONES: GERRARD 644 645 (TRUNKS) Empire House, 175 & 176, Piccadilly. London W.1 12th July 1918. To: - The Clerk to the            Tribunal, Dear Sir, RE Percy David Smerdon Vokes. of 73 North Parade, Aberystwyth. Should your Tribunal see their way to grant this man exemption if he obtains work of National Importance, we have the honour to state that he is working for us at the present time as a foreman of timber hauliers. Owing to this previous experience in the timber trade in Canada he is a very useful man for this purpose, and we should find it difficult to adequately replace him. Most of the timber which he is engaged in hauling is being consigned to collieries for use as pit props, and we probably need not point out that this is work of the greatest possible national importance, inasmuch as it is impossible to obtain coal without pit props, and that, therefore, every branch of munition work must obviously be affected by the supply of pit props being maintained.
