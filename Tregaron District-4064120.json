I am the son of a widow who has worked single-handed, & the utmost diligence and care, to rear up the seven little children, the eldest of whom was a girl of only twelve years, whom her husband left behind him thirteen years ago.  What mother devoted herself more wholeheartedly: what mother worked more laboriously though she was beset by storms and tempests which she alone could have borne, and of which she alone knew the bitterness; what mother faced greater perils and fought more strenuously, than she did to get food for, and to rear her little children?  And, at last, is she to see the fruit of all her toil, of all her industry, of all her divine care, thrown away with no reward, with no compensation? I implore you, do not desert her!  Add no more to the burdens she has sustained.  Let her not be a \"Rahel weeping for her children\".

He is a diligent and conscientious student and has made the best use of his time up to the present.

Our land  is probably the most hilly and difficult  to work in the whole parish of Llangeitho. In addition we farm Pantanamlwg; three miles away, which is about 10 acres in extent. I have to do a great part of the ploughing and other farming work as my eldest brother is subject to nervous complaints and for days together he is not do now work of any kind. The particular duties which are allocated  to me as one of the owners is the  buying and selling  of all the sheep and cattle as I have always had the sole care of the cattle and sheep. A farm of the acres of Cilcert having 15 horses, 32 head of cattle and 110  sheep besides calves and lambs requires  at least 4 or 5 male out door workers, and since Father's death last September we have been reduced to 3, and we have only one young girl (14) in the house, besides an aged mother and one sister to take the whole charge of  the household duties. If I am withdrawn from the farm, we shall have to sell up the whole place as my brothers  could never manage the place, and it is quite impossible to find a substitute as labour is so scarce.<p>Signature of appellant: Evan Green<p>Date: 1916-03-18T16:47:10.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

It comprises 200 acres of land and 200 acres of mountain land, making a total of 400 acres. It is the largest farm in Tregaron Union. I pay £200 rent. Father is 70 years of age and the only brother I have at home with me is John Davies aged 32. I am 27 years of age. My other brother David is in a certified occupation following an entire horse the property of Messrs J. Davies & Sons. We have 400 sheep, we have 50 acres under hay this year and 50 acres under corn. We have 70 heads of cattle including 18 milking cows. The farm is a very laborious one and we have to use 3 horses in the cart. The mountain land is over 2 miles away from the farm and it requires the attention of one man almost entirely to attend to the sheep particularly this time of the year. My father is unable to do work on the farm as formerly, and the whole responsibility is now on my shoulders. We have 25 young calves there this year and it is one of the most productive farms in the whole district. We have been there 12 years and since we have been there we have materially improved the farm and have spared no money or labour to bring it into a proper state of cultivation. We have on several occasions taken prizes for the best farm in the district. I produce the receipts for the rent to shew that I am a joint tenant of the farm. No certificate was sent to me in pursuance of the statute giving the decision of the local tribunal and the appeal was heard in my absence.

One of these (who had been in my employ for nearly 20 years) is on war work and this I am left with only Morgan to do the work which two could not cope with. This necessitates my appeal, and this branch would be totally destroyed if not granted. As I have to buy goods in advance, which for some time to come had been done before the other man left, I have thus a big stock of materials on hand, which if not cleared this season will be out of date and thus I shall be a great loser. I may state that the extent of my business as a whole could be judged from the fact that I am one of the heaviest noted persons in the district: and the tailoring branch is absolutely one of the most essential portions of it. I may add that 2 of my sons have been out for over 12 months - the only assistant of military age and the Cutter have gone, and as far as business is concerned, this is the only appeal I have made and shall make. Morgans is absolutely essential, as you will see, to the business: and if otherwise I should not have troubled you.<p>Previous applications: No<p>Signature: Rees Jones<p>Address: Emporium Tregaron<p>Date of application: 1916-06-23T09:25:22.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: Conditional Exemption. \nJuly 8 1916.\n J Lloyd <p>Tag: Beige R41/42: Page 2",

I beg to appeal against this decision on the grounds:-\n(1) that the Tribunal failed to appreciate my position as sole manager worker on a Holding of about 20 acres. All the work connected with cultivation and the management of the stock, which comprises 1 horse, 5 cattle, and  2 pigs, devolves on me personally. There is no other person available to perform this work, and in the event of my being called up for Military Service, a Holding of 20 acres would be left uncultivated, and the stock enumerated above uncared for. The  Tribunal does not appear to have realized this aspect of my case, and they  have altogether ignored the wishes of  the Board of Agriculture that every acre of land should be cultivated in view of the necessities of the war. My father and mother who live with me are 84 and 72 years of age respectively.\n(2) that the Tribunal has overlooked the fact that I am physically unfit. I suffer from periodical attacks of Asthma & Bronchitis. Last  winter I was bed ridden for 3 months, and under medical treatment, and for last 6 years I have been liable to serious attacks of this nature. However, with care, I am able to perform the work which the above Holding entails, and submit that, in the national interests, I should be doing more  vital service by being allowed to remain on the Holding than by joining the colours. <p>Signature of appellant: Tom Richard Phillips<p>Address of appellant: as above<p>Why appellant acts for the man: 13. 3 of my brothers are engaged in work of national importance; one joined the  R.T.A; the 2nd, who is physically unfit is engaged in munition work at Woolwich Arsenal; the 3rd also physically unfit with the Y.M.C.A. at Cardiff.<p>Date: 1916-07-10T10:30:55.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

I am desirous to be as reasonable as possible, and I would say, as a last resort, that I should be willing for my son to join for military service, provided as efficient substitute is found.\n\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Owen.\n\nP.S.

Two months ago I graduated in the University of Wales and if I am allowed I can try for a scholarship at Oxford next January.  Now that I have adopted a special line of study, any break will involve going over old work.

Owing to the misunderstanding on the part of the Military Representative who appears to have informed the Local Tribunal without my knowledge or sanction on my part my claim was disallowed, and in the circumstances I respectfully submit that the case should be heard on its merits.\n\nMy Case is as follows:-\n\nThat the Services of my Son, the said Evan Walter Jones, are absolutely indespensible as I am unable to secure the services of another man-servant.\n\nMy farm consists of 80 acres of grazing and arable land.  This year I have only about 7 1/2 acres under Corn, and about 3 1/2 acres of green crops.  I could not plough more for want of labour.  I have about 28 acres of Hay, and the rest is pasture land.\n\nI always have kept one man-servant to work the farm, and he has been assisted by my Brother at odd times.  Since July last I have had the services of my said son, Evan Walter Jones, and the occasional help of the said Walter Jones.\n\nMy stock consists of 2 working Horses, and 2 Young Horses, one rising 3 and the other 4 years.  I have 7 Milking Cows, 8 Yearlings, and 8 Calves, and 70 Sheep.\n\nThis year my said Brother ploughed a portion of the land, but I had to rely upon the help of neighbours of plough the larger part.\n\nThe said Walter Jones is a Horse-Dealer, and I shall not be able to secure his services for the future, and shall therefore be entirely dependent upon my said son.\n\nJohn Jones.<p>Name of Tribunal: Unknown<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

My business, as is known, is long-established and has supplied the needs of the neighbourhood for many years.  The outfitting and Tailoring Department is one of the essentials of the trade, and the work which engaged another cutter before the war, and which is heavier than ever has now to be done by person I am appealing for.     \n\n2. As is known, the hiring season is the busiest time of the year in the trade, and as our Tailoring Department is more in touch with the farms, and farm-servants, than others, the coming time renders to Morgan's services indispensable.  The orders for the coming year's working clothes daily pour in, and as the farmers have been temporarily exempted, more orders will be on hand during the coming weeks.    \n\n3. Considering that he is the last of five who have already joined - 2 sons, 3 employees - and this is the only appeal I shall make, I think I am entitled to his services.\n<p>Previous applications: (a) June 23rd, 1916.    \n(b) (illegible) by Mr. Rees Jones.

Gentlemen, I, the undersigned hereby declare that the grounds upon which my son, John Henry Davies, aged 18 years, basis his claim for exemption from military service are correct.\nI may add that he acts as carter, horseman (from horses) and ploughman (23 acres annually).  As my farm consists of 76 acres of land - arable and pasture - and as my son is the only male labourer I employ, it would be absolutely impossible for me ( I am 59 years of age) to carry on the work without his help.  As far as I can see, the only alternative would be for me to give up farming, and that would be financially impossible.

I am 64 years of age and my time and attention is taken up on the management, shepherding, fencing and other necessary things.

The orders from the district now in hand are enormous and the call on the department is greater than ever, and Morgans does his utmost to cope with it.  It is apparent that losing him would mean a closing of the tailoring branch and a heavy below to my business.\n\n2. The only men of age in Draping Dept. has enlisted long ago, and my daughter has had to undertake shop work.  My two sons -  Dr. D. Rhys Jones and Private J. Rhys Jones - voluntarily joined and are now at the front, and from this my connection with the war can be judged.\n\n3.  This is the only application for exemption I have made, and shall make; and it is only the absolute necessity of keeping Morgans, that compels me to do this.\n\n4.

From 50 - 55 acres are comprised of Clover & Meadow Grass.  There are 15 horses, and the number of Cattle vary from 65 - 73, of which 15 Cows in Milk. Over 30 calves are bred every year; 10 stall & yard fed Cattle have been sold with year and there are about 20 more to be disposed of.  All the food for maintaining the stock is raised solely on the farm, and as I am contemplating increasing the production of food, there will also be a corresponding increase in the size of stock.  But the plain fact cannot be evaded that this is absolutely unthinkable if I am robbed of the services of this Cowman.  I should then be reduced to the same position exactly(?) as Farmers with from 60 -80 acres, and should only be able to work one team of horses, the 2 other teams being idle.

The applicant keeps two horses,and has been able to help many of the Small-holders,and this year has ploughed,harrowed and sown 12 acres of land in addition to his own 4 acres. He has further undertaken to harvest the crops.His trade as a Butcher and BaconCurer is a considerable one.He is physically unfit for Military Duty.

As you already know, my business as Draper is very large, and one of its chief departments is that of Tailoring, and I need not say that the Tailoring meets the essential essential needs of the Agricultural community.\n2.  Before the war, I employed 2 Tailors on the premises and 5 others.  Of these 5, one alone remains in my employ and the person I am appealing for - W. Morgan - remains on the premises.  His partner, who was in charge of the \"Cutting\" left for the Munition Works, and the whole responsibility of \"Cutting\" and of the department generally has, for the past 18 months, rested on W.Morgan.  It would thus be impossible to carry on the department without him, as ordinary tailors, leave alone \"Cutters\" are impossible to be replaced.\n3. My only 2 sons have joined early, Capt. Dr. D.R. Jones has been at the front for 15 months, and Private J. R. Jones is, to my grief, missing since May 27.\n4. The only person of Military Age in the Draper's Dept has enlisted, and the work there has to be carried on by my daughters,\n5. I state these to explain my position in regard to the war, and I candidly affirm that I would not appeal in this case, were not W.

Mr. W. Morgan for whom I appeal, is alone left on the premises and does all the Cutting of the Department.\n\n3.   The Tailoring Dept/. meets the essential needs of our Agricultural Community, and at present, I have on hand, more orders than ever, and a very large supply of materials to meet these.  If Mr. W. Morgan was taken from me, these orders and materials would become  absolutely void.\n\n4.  I may state that I have no other man of military age in the business - my elder son, Private J. Elija Jones is to my grief missing since May 1917.  My other son - Captain Dr. D. Rhys Jones, is at Salonica:  other employees have enlisted and my daughters have to cope with the shop's work .\n\n5.

I am instructed by my Executive to draw your attention to the above case, who is one of our members.  This is a case of serious financial and domestic hardship, and will mean certain financial ruin if this man is taken for Military Service.  We most respectfully desire to draw your attention to the provisions contained in Paragraf D. Statutory Rules and Orders 1918 No.495 of Regulation 185.  We also desire to draw your attention to Mr. Becks statement in the House of Commons on July 3rd last when replying to a question by Mr. Snowden (Lab) Blackburn, \"Stated\" In view of cases of exceptional hardship brought to his notice, Sir Auckland Geddes decided to relax by administrative action, the rules with regard to the recruiting of persons affected by the proclamations of April 20th and June 14th.  He accordingly gave instructions to Directors of National Service in the various Regions indefinately to postpone the call to join the colours of men whose cases are clearly exceptional, even if outside the strict limit laid down by the proclamation.  We have no desire to convey any hostile feeling in this matter, and are only desirous that these instructions, which were agreed to by the National Federation of One Man Business Association and the Ministry of National Service and the Local Government Board should be acted upon in the interest both of the individual and of the community.

I humbly crave for leave to be re-examined by the Medical Board as I feel I am not fit for Grade 1. I was offered by my employer to work underground but I was unable to go underground as a Miner on account of my weak condition. Had I been able to work underground I should have received more wages and would have been employed for a less number of hours a day but I have had to work on the surface on account of my health.  I submit if I am graded One and able to go abroad I should also be fit to work underground which I am not able to do.  I am not able to take proper food and I have to be very careful what I eat since I suffered from appendicitis.

Mother is 78 years of age, and I am manager without partner. \nb) No other butcher resides in Pontrhydfendigaid and the locality nearby entirely depends on Butter Hall for its meat supplies.\nc) Business transactions are such that it would involve great hardship and loss to me if broken up by my departure, for the annual turnover is heavy, it can be farmed if desired, and I have a wife and three children to maintain, the eldest only 13 years of age. \n<p>Previous applications: (i) no  (ii) no<p>Signature: Evan Hughes<p>Address: none given<p>Occupation, profession or business: none given<p>Date of application: 1918-07-03T17:31:56.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: Temporary three months July 16 1918<p>Tag: Beige R41/42: Page 2",
