Brynheulwen Llanfarian on the following grounds:-\n1. Mr Edward Stephens who has been in business on his own account for over 6 years has been executing work for each one of us whose names are signed below and we appeal for his exemption.\n2. He has expended a large sum of money in erecting an oil engine for sawing purposes at his building yard in Brynheulwen and all his capital is invested in his trade as a Carpenter, Builder and Wheelwright. He has been executing repairs and making alterations to carts and cart wheels and making new carts and new wheels for us who are farmers in the district. Without having carts we could not possibly carry on farming operations and his services to us as agriculturalists are indispensable.\n3. He has also been repairing outbuildings and dwellinghouses for us and it would be impossible for us to carry on farming operations without having proper buildings, doors, windows, &c. to house our cattle and also to our own residences.\n4. It will be a serious hardship for the District in general if he is taken away as he is the only Carpenter, Wheelwright &c. who is available for general work for many miles around Llan-farian. There are other Carpenters living in the District but they have all gone away from home or work in Aberystwyth. He has to our knowledge now several contracts on hand all of which are left unfinished.\n\nWe humbly Petition that his services may be retained by us:\nJohn P.

In July 1914 I competed for prizes at the Wileh National Show at Newport. Amongst the entrees were a good number of well known expert bee-keepers from all parts of the country.

Elias Lewis the father and his wife live there together with William Thomas Lewis aged 19 and john aged 29 and a daughter who is 16 years of age. John Lewis was conditionally exempted on the 25th March 1916. About 25 to 30 acres of land is ploughed every year. there are 5 working horses 3 young horses 30 heads of cattle 120 sheep & 20 ewes. William Thomas Lewis has sole charge of the horses and the ploughing and harrowing. Elias Lewis the father is suffering from chronic bronchitis and has been so for the least 10 years. Recently he has had very severe attacks of hemorrhage. He is attended by Dr Rowland of Aberystwyth whose certificate was filled at the local tribunal. The father cannot do any work at all on the farm. It takes 3 horses to take manure from the farmyard to the fields as it is a very laborious farm to cultivate. It is impossible to get assistance to work on the farm as men are so very scarce and it will be impossible to to work on the farm with John only who has got to attend to the cattle. As I am asthmatic I am unable to do any work myself. If my so William Thomas Lewis has to go away I shall have to give up the farm as it will be useless my attempting to carry it on                              <p>Signature of appellant: Elias Lewis <p>Address of appellant: Pengwmryn, gapel Bangor, Aberystwyth  <p>Occupation, profession or business: Farmer<p>Date: 1916-03-27T14:16:10.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

There is only one other shoemaker in this parish of 1019 inhabitants.  There is only one Boot repairer between Llanrhystyd and Aberystwyth, 9 miles away, & he is over five miles off.

I work for people 7 miles of & have customers in Llanddeiniol, Llangwyryfon Llansantffraed & Blaenpenal also.  A petition signed by 41 farmers, agricultural labourers & others above military age in support of exempting me from military service for the convenience of the district was sent to the Local Tribunal where it was stated that they took no notice of Petitions.

We keep 8 horses and it requires 3 horses to take every load of manure to the fields under cultivation and in certain cases we have to use 4 horses in the cart. Owing to the state of the land we have got to plough it twice in most cases. We grow oats, barley and wheat, a large quantity of potatoes, turnips, swedes, and mangolds. It is impossible for one man to work the farm. I have one sister at home who is in a very delicate state of health and I am also under Doctor's hands very often. I produce a Medical Certificate from Dr Ellis of Aberystwyth to shew what my state of health now is. To plough and sow and harrow the land requires two able bodied men. We have 9 milking cows and there are altogether between sheep yearlings and everything, about 140 heads of cattle to look after. I am single and my brother William James is also single. My other brother is a Master Tailor and he employs a married man to help him with the tailoring work. He is fully occupied with his trade as a Tailor. I am the person solely responsible for the buying and selling of the cattle and my brother assists me with the horses. I have carried on Esgair farm for the last seven years and I do all the sowing on the land and I have also the sole charge of making ricks of corn in the rick yard and thatch them. I also do the milking of the cattle as my sister is too weak to do all the milking. Formerly we used to keep an Englishman to help us. We failed to get one this year and weare therefore short of one man this year. <p>Signature of appellant: John James<p>Address of appellant: Esgair, Llanrhystyd, Aberystwyth<p>Occupation, profession or business: Farmer<p>Date: 1916-04-03T14:47:25.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

The stock on the holding comprises 18 head of cattle, 2 horses and 600 sheep. I am in sole charge of the sheep and in addition I do general farm work when not occupied with the sheep. My brother does all the ploughing and looks after the horses. My father, aged 75 years, is partly dependent upon me as well as an invalid brother and an unmarried sister who  looks after my father and brother. My brother and I have during the past 3 years brought into  cultivation an addition field in the holding by our labours. The lambing season is now in full swing and will not be over until the end of May and if my services as shepherd are witheld during this period, the result will be disasturous as the sheepwalk is on a mountain about a mile from the dwelling house. I claim exemption on the ground that my services are indispensable to the working of the holding and that my occupation of shepherd is a reserved occupation. Serious hardship will fall upon my brother and my dependents if I am called up for service as it will be impossible for my brother to carry on the holding alone and he cannot afford to pay wages to a workman ever if he could secure one, and it is only by both working on the holding that we are able to make make both ends meet. In addition, all our capital is invested in the holding. <p>Signature of appellant: David Charles Burrell <p>Date: 1916-03-18T13:46:59.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

He occasionally helps at Llettyspence farm but I am solely dependent upon my son Lewis James as my other son has a wife and one child dependent upon him. My son John James has been the Assistant Overseer for over 16 years for the parish of Trefeirig and he also holds other appointments I could not attempt to carry on the farm without the help of my son Lewis James and as above stated I, his sister and his Aunt are dependent upon his services. Lewis James has also the ploughing of 23 acres for small holders in the district of Cwmerfin and the sowing harrowing and harvesting of that is done by him.

He has been employed with me from childhood and during several years past he has been carrying in and out for me goods amounting to the annual value of £4,000 to £5,000 comprising flour, indian meal, corn &c. and he is the only one to handle sacks of corn &c and deliver them to the respective customers. He has got the sole charge of two horses. I am in the shop myself. Formerly I had as many as 5 persons in the shop with me, but now  William Richard Morris is the only one.  I have a young boy 9 years old helping in the shop.  William Richard Morris was 20 last July. We deliver sacks of seeds to customers at a radius of 8 or 9 miles and I pay annually over £200 for seeds.  I have 2 other sons who are now about joining the colours.  I have applied for an Assistant above military age to assist me in the business but I have been unsuccessful.  I humbly apply for a short extension of time particularly during the present busy (sowing) time.  I do not object to his going out but all Iwant is a short extension of time to meet the arrangements of my business.  I am prepared to allow the Tribunal (privately) to inspect my bank pass books which I shall produce before the tribunal.<p>Signature of appellant: J.J.Morris<p>Address of appellant: Temperance House, Llanilar<p>Occupation, profession or business: General Merchant<p>Date: 2016-04-24T09:17:14.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

I am the only person at home with her.  I have been employed for over 18 years as Assistant Teacher at the Council School Goginan.  I live at home at Penllwyn and I leave the house at 9 o'clock in the morning, go back to midday meal, and then return to my Mother before 5 o'clock.  The sole responsibility for my Mother rests on my shoulders.  Recently I have been temporarily transferred to Cwmystwyth owing to the removal of the head teacher from Cwmystwyth School but I am informed I shall be re-instated at Goginan after the Whitsuntide holidays.  While at Cwmystwyth I used to leave home on Monday morning returning on Wednesday nights, go back again to Cwmystwyth on Thursday morning, returning home on Friday nights, so practically I was only away Monday-Tuesday and Thursday nights from my home.  During my absence I got one of the neighbours to go in and out of the house but it has been impossible for me to get a permanent person to stay with my mother.  I have tried and have communicated with my brothers who are away in London and have failed entirely to get any one.  I am the youngest son.  I have sacrificed a great deal by remaining at home with my mother.  I have no sister.  I have refused 2 Headships to remain at home.  There is no female at Penllwyn or in the district whose services I could secure to attend on my mother.  At present I cook all the meals for my mother and I wait upon her.  She suffers from acute rheumatism and she has to be helped and assisted throughout the day & it is not safe to leave her for any length of time alone in the house.

During the latter half of August and the beginning of September when milling and swing will be at their lowest ebb the applicant must overhaul and repair the machinery, line the waterwheel and clear up the mill leet and pond. Last year a new brick surface was fixed on the kiln at a cost of £20 and much of the labour involved had to be performed by him in addition to the annual work just mentioned. At the end of September, this year's grain will begin to come in and the following three months will form the busiest time of the year particularly in milling wheat and the production of feeding stuffs for fattening pigs and cattle. The personal labour of two grown up persons is necessary to carry on the mill and the farm. When the father worked at the Mill, and the two brothers were young he had to employ a grown up servant to cultivate the land and look after horses and cattle. There is now three times as much land and three times as many animals on the land. The following are the particulars as shown on the account book kept at the Mill: From beginning of year up to June 10th (23 weeks) - \n242 snacks of wheat were turned into flour. Weekly average - 10 1/2 \n103 \"     \" oats \"      \"         \" oatmeal \"          \"   - 4 1/2\n491 \"          \" barley & other grain \" feeding stuffs for amimals. \" \" - 21. More wheat was grown last year by farmers in response to the appeal made by the Board of Agriculture. During the same period the saw mill turned out 1305 fencing posts and material for 53 gates. Large quantities of larch, ash, oak, and beech, have been sawn for agricultural and other purposes. At present, there are about 12 tons of timber waiting to be sawn. Joseph James 16th June 1916.

Mr Branford is the only plumber in a district of eight miles radius, and to take him away would leave us in a very precarious position indeed. It is unnecessary to point out the importance of Sanitation, drainage & water supply and the evil consequences following the neglect of these matters are well known. Mr Branford is the one that takes care of these important items in our way and in our humble opinion he is about the most indispensable man in the whole district and it remains a mystery to everybody why the Rural Tribunal acted as they did with his Case.\n\nWe Sincerely Trust that in the interest of the health of this dustruct you will grant him exemption from military sevice\n\nYours truly\nT.

I am forty years of age and married with one child. The only assistant I had in my employ has been called up for service and as I have been unable to replace him with a man of non-military age, I am consequently very much behind with the work I now have in hand.  I am the only Sanitary and Water Plumber in the village of Borth and I do all the repair work in connection with the water supplies at Borth, Ynyslas, and Llanfihangel. In addition I do all the sanitary repairs to the houses at Borth which are equipped with modern systems of drainage. I claim exemption on the ground that I am employed in a service of public utility as being engaged in connection with the provision and distribution of water. My only child is in a very delicate state of health and is constant source of expense to me and only recently she had to undergo an operation which will have to be repeated at an early date.

An Inspector under the Ministry of Munitions recently inspected our works and the work of the men employed there as a result of our application for badges for John James Thomas and others of our men, and the Inspector certified that 95% of our work must be considered War Work. We have accordingly received badges for all the men we applied for including John James Thomas from the Ministry of Munitions, and we accordingly beg to support his appeal as we are very short of labour for the important work we have on hand.

My eldest child is 10 years old, and my youngest child is 6 months old. The latter is a weakly child, subject to convulsions. I was head farm servant and ploughman  at Maenelin farm, Llanddeiniol, comprising 200 acres of cultivated land up to 6 years ago. Owing to my wife's illness and to enable me to help at home, which I am only able to do by living at home, I became a farm and general labourer, and worked for various farmers in the neighbourhood. Owing to the number and youth of my children and their constant needs, my wife is unable without my assistance to manage the house, and unless I take her place she is never able to leave home. In addition to my regular work as labourer, I am a Molecatcher and am employed by a large number of neighbouring farms. My services as farm labourer are in great demand in my neighbourhood. \n\nWilliam James Jones<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Rural District<p>Number of Case: 90<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

He has been on \n\"Active Service abroad for over a year last past with the Royal \n\"Naval Air Service, Eastern Mediterranean Force and previously \n\"he was on Active Service in France. That Gwynfryn Mansion has \n\"been vacant since the month of April last, and until the new\n \"tenant enters into occupation at Michaelmas next the Apllicant is \n\"dependent upon the said Sydney Bryan as Caretaker and Gardener. \n\"Gwynfryn is a furnished house and the grounds and land require \n\"the constant attention. He is the only hired male servant in\n\"the Applicant's service at Gwynfryn and works the Petrol Engine \n\"which pumps water to the House and Cottage. He is absolutely \n\"indispensable. It has been found impossible to find a \n\"substitute for Sydney Bryan.\"\nWhen the previous application was made the new tenant was, as stated above, to have entered into occupation of Gwynfryn Mansion at Michaelmas, 1916, but owing to unforeseen circumstances he has been detained, and is still in the Argentine, and the date of his return to England is uncertain and the Applicant therefore applies for a renewal or variation of the existing Certificate of Exemption. <p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Rural District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

There is only one other Boot business in the whole parish. Population is over 1,000 with an Elementary School within half a mile of my workshop and I have an extensive business in repairing boots for children attending the Schools. I have customers at Llangwyryfon Llanddeinol Blaenpenal and Llannon. There is a serious scarcity of Shoemakers and repairers in my district. There are 9 miles from my workshop to Aberystwyth and only one Shoe repairer and he is 5 miles away. Nine miles to Talsarn and no shoemaker. 8 miles to Bronant and no shoemaker. I have to work very long hours and I have now enough work for 2 workmen but I cannot get any assistance owing to the scarcity of men. I have a widowed mother keeeping my house and she is mainly dependent upon my earnngs. Serious hardship would ensue if I gave up my business. I have invested all my money in the business and my money is out in the country with my customers. I appeal for conditional exemption owing to my exceptional financial and business obligations + also my domestic postition. My business has been established for over 65 years. It was kept by Evan Lewis for 37 years By my father for 21 years and by myself for seven years.<p>Signature of appellant: David Timothy Morris<p>Address of appellant: Tyr Capel RhiwbwysLlanrhystyd<p>Date: 1916-10-20T11:20:14.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

One third of it is only accessible by a rough track along the edge of the  sea cliffs for 600 yds and after it is reached it is very hilly and dangerous. (b) I have endeavoured to do everything in my power to raise the maximum amount of food on the holding. During last season I have used artificial manure to the value of over £30. I changed practically the whole of my seed during last spring to ensure good crops. Acting on the advice of the Government I have sown more catch crops than anybody in the district. The acreage of Glan y mor is 100 acres in addition to that I have 44 acres of rough grazing ground 13 miles away which I own and hold because it fits in with Glanymor during the dry summer when grass fails. Also I have a field of 12 acres close to Aberystwyth that I have taken for the same purpose. (c) Other farmers have been allowed to keep their men while not doing the same amount of work.

I am the tenant of Frondeg Farm, 105 acres.  My Son, David Davies, the tenant of Ffosrhydgaled Farm of 71 acres which adjoins Frondeg lives with us at Frondeg and he manages entirely both Farms with one Staff namely, Himself, his Wife,  a Female Servant, and three servant men namely David Hugh James, aged 21, William Edwards aged 18, and John Morris Evans, aged 17. My said son is 54 years of age. The total acreage of the two farms is 176 acres. The Stock on the two farms is as follows :- 15 Milking Cows, 17 two-year old Cattle, 16 Horses, 8 of which are in regular work and 8 are young Ponies, 66 English Sheep , about 30 pigs, 12 Yearling Cattle, and 2 Bulls. About 60 acres of land on the two farms are ploughed annually for the usual Corn and Green Crops. It will be practically impossible for the two farms to be carried on if David Hugh James has to leave our Service, and it is only owing to the arrangement made for the working of the two farms together that they can be carried on with the present staff. The annual rent of Frondeg is £68 a year and that of Ffosrhydygaled £80 a year. David Hugh James is the only one on the farm who is able to plough. I have two other Sons, one of whom, aged 51, is married and in business in London, and the other, aged 40, is with the Pembrokeshire Yeomanry in Egypt.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Rural District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

The shop is a necessity and a great convenience to the inhabitants of Upper Borth and Glanywern and farmers resident South of Borth.  It has taken the Applicant 12 years to establish his business.  He has no relatives or other competent persons who can carry on his business as manager or otherwise, and his business would have to be closed down if he is taken for Military Service, as at present it would be practically impossible to find a purchaser.  Once closed down, there would be no prospect of the business being hereafter revived.\nApplicant's mother is aged 75 years, has been an invalid for the last 12 years, and suffers from bronchitis and eczema (feet and hands) she has no near relatives to attend to her and is entirely dependent upon the Applicant for her maintenance care and comfort.  Applicant in addition to managing his business has to undertake the household duties.<p>Whether any previous application has been made: Yes, to the Aberystwyth Local Tribunal on the 13th July 1916 when Exemption granted until 30th August 1916.

There is only one other boot business in the whole parish.  population is over 1,000 with an Elementary School within half a mile of my workshop and I have an extensive business in repairing  boots for children attending the schools.  I have customers in Llangwyryfon Llanddeiniol Blaenpenal and Llanon.  There is a serious scarcity of Shoemakers and Repairers in my district.  There are 9 miles from my workshop to Aberystwyth and only one Shoe Repairer and he is 5 miles away.  Nine miles to Talsarn and no Shoemaker. 8 miles to Bronant and no Shoemaker.  I have to work very long hours and I have now enough work for two workmen but I cannot get any assistance owing to the scarcity of men.  I have a widowed Mother keeping my house and she is mainly dependent upon my earnings. Serious hardship would ensue if I gave up my business.  I have invested all my money in the business and my money is out in the country with my customers.  I appeal for conditional exemption owing to my exceptional financial and business obligations and also my domestic position.  My business had been established for over 65 years.  It was kept by Evan Lewis for 37 years, by my father for 21 years, and by myself for seven years.\nI have since the last hearing been examined by the Medical Board and been certified in Class C1.\nI apply for a re-hearing of my appeal.<p>Name of Tribunal: Dosbarth Gwledig Aberystwyth<p>Number of Case: 158<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

He has been employed with me since August last.   That the timber now being felled is on behalf of Messrs John Brown & Co. of Sheffield who are Government Contractors.  The Appellant claims exemption on the ground that John Victor Evans Stephens is in a certified occupation and is entitled to exemption.  No notice was delivered by the respondent that he would contend notwithstanding the employee was in a certified occupation it was unnecessary to retain him in civil occupation.  The Appellant relies upon para.7 of the Certified Occupations List as to the time he commenced work namely August 1916.<p>Signature of appellant: Per pro Walter Boynton, W Rhodes, Manager<p>Address of appellant: Lea, Gainsborough<p>Date: 1917-02-06T18:16:51.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

I have 19 heads of cattle and 5 horses, and without the help of Jenkin Morgan Evans or a substitute it is impossible for me to plough the land and to cultivate the same. I have only one son and he joined the Navy over 12 months ago. My wife is in a delicate state of health, and is now bedridden. Some of the land cultivated by me is very difficult and laborious to plough, and I have got to use 3 horses, and without help it is impossible for me to carry on farming operations. I was led to believe that substitute would be provided for me instead of Evan Morgan Jenkins and I was also informed that they were not going to take away indispensable persons from the farms until April or May. I now apply for leave to retain him in my services until the above period or that I should get a substitute instead of him.

I apply for a rehearing on the following grounds : - (1) That if this man has to go hardship will ensue to myself and it will be  a loss to the Country as my son, the casual labourer and myself, who will be the remaining male persons on the farm, are all unable to plough. (2) That according to the scale of the Man Power Board I am entitled to one horseman at least. (3) That prior to the hearing of the said appeal I had been laid up for several weeks and attended by my Doctor and in consequence of my weak state of health I omitted to place before the Tribunal the facts of my case and intended to instruct Mr. A. J. Hughes Solicitor of Aberystwyth to appear on my behalf but he too was incapacitated through illness from attending the tribunal.

The ploughing is done by a neighbour and we have to repay him by assisting him on his farm as he requires us during sowing time, carting manure, hay and corn harvest time &c &c.  We cannot get anyone to ploughthe land for us unless we repay them by services on their farms.  My son is the only one who is able to do farm work.  I injured my wrist two years ago and I cannot do heavy work.  My age is 56.  We have a quantity of wheat barley and oats now ready to be threshed.

In addition to this I have got 50 acres of grass land on part of Tancastell farm which I hold separately from Penbwlch farm. David Morgan Hughes is my sole manager and bailiff as I am a cripple and cannot do any work myself.  I have another man of 27 and formerly had 2 boys of 17 assisting.  I am leaving the farm of Penbwlch next September.  I have already sold some of my stock and the whole of the crop I have got to harvest before 29th September and the only person I can rely on for this purpose is David Morgan Hughes. The other 50 acres I have got 20 acres under hay.  The cutting of the corn and the stacking thereof will be entirely under the supervision of David Morgan Hughes. I propose to use 2 reaping machines for the harvest, one by David Morgan Hughes and the other by the other man I have got. I do not live on the farm now.  David Morgan Hughes is constantly on the farm morning noon and night.  He has also got to attend to the sheep &c. which I could not do.  David Morgan Hughes is an applicant for the farm himself and backwards and forwards he has been with me for the last ten years.  Up to three years agp I was able to go about myself bust since last winter I cannot be without help.

I can do very little myself as I cannot lift up one of my arms. <p>Signature: John Jones<p>Date: 1916-02-23T15:50:20.000Z<p>Decision of Tribunal: Conditional exemption so long as he remains in the same occupation and indispensable.

Minister, Cwmystwyth<p>Transcription: Re Mr Thomas Morgan, Tyrhyd, Cwmyswyth\nI have known Mr Thomas Morgan, Tyrhyd, Cwmystwyth, for the last fourteen years, and I have no hesitation in saying that he is totally unfit for any kind of military service.\nFrom 1904 to 1911 he was confined to his home by Asthma. Not only was he unable to do any work during that period so as to earn a livelihood, but suffered considerable pain. He spent several weeks and frequently longer periods without being able to lie down in bed.\nDuring the latter part of 1911 he was accidentally advised to try Doctor Tucker's \"Asthma Specific\". He secured the medicine immediately together with Doctor Tucker's \"Atomizer\", without which he could not inhale the medicine. After using it for about six months, he was able to go out of doors and commence work, and has been able to earn a livelihood ever since. For the last four years, during which he has had sufficient relief from Asthma to follow his employment as Roadman, he has been obliged to use the above mentioned Specific daily. A few days neglect would bring on an acute attack.\nDuring last August, he failed to secure a supply of the Specific, owing to Government restrictions re Cocaine, and was consequently confined to his house for three months, and was again unable to lie down in bed. At last he was premitted to have the supply again, and has followed his employment since. Mr Morgan, not only has to use this medicine at home, but is obliged to take the device with him to work to afford him relief. He is a martyr to acute asthma\nD.H. Lloyd\nC.M.

I also supply neighbouring farmers with goods necessary for cattle.  The shop is a necessity and a great convenience for the inhabitants of Upper Borth and Glanywern and farmers resident south of Borth.  It has taken me 12 years  to establish the business.  I have no relatives or other competent persons who can carry on the business as Manager or otherwise and the business would have to be closed down if I am taken for Military Service, as at present it is impossible to find a purchaser.  Once closed down there would be no prospect of the business being hereafter revived.  My mother is 75 years of age and has been an invalid for the last 12 years and suffers from bronchitis and eczema (feet and hands) she has no near relatives to attend her and is entirely dependent  upon me for her maintenance  care and comfort.

[Thomas James] Waddingham' at bottom-right.<p>Transcription: This appeal is made on the ground that I am understaffed for carrying out work that is necessary in the National Interest to be done on my Hafod Estate of 16000 acres.\n\nI have a farm in hand of 370 acres of which 210 are mountain - 64 3/4 under the plough - 58 1/2 hay. 37 pasture.\n\nThis year the arable land is cropped thus:- 17 acres wheat, 32 1/2ac oats, 4ac linseed, 3ac potatoes, 8 1/4ac roots.\n\nMy stock is 7 agricultural horses requiring 3 men to follow them, 2 young horses, 18 cows, 22 young cattle, 570 sheep and lambs, 6 pigs.\n\nThe cattle are for the most part pedigree shorthorns reared with the object of providing pure bred bulls for sale in the district to improve the quality of the local cattle.\n\nThe rearing of young bulls require more labour that that of rearing bullocks as after a certain age one cannot allow the former out at grass.\n\nBesides the stock bull bought at Penrith at a cost of £242 I have 4 bulls calved in 1917 - all requiring more attention than can be given by an unexperienced person. Further I do not consider it right to put a woman in charge of such animals as they are never to be trusted.\n\nMy cowman has to feed and to exercise these bulls, milk the cows, feed the calves and pigs, go around the mountain each day to see the sheep so that especially in maggoty weather he has as much as he can do.\n\nIn addition to this cowman I have on the farm only 4 men and one girl - One of these four has for some time been in a very delicate state of health which caused him in January 1916 to give up the horses having worked them for 13 years. He has not been able to do a full days work for some time past.\n\nThe farm is an awkward one to work having 3 sets of buildings in the form of a triangle, each rather over a mile from the next to it.\n\nIt is a very high lying farm some of the arable land being over 900ft above sea level - very hilly and difficult to work.\n\nThe rain fall is heavy - averaging for the past four years 61 1/2 inches per annum against 45 3/4 at Lampter, 43 1/2 at Aberystwyth, so as a necessary consequence we do not get as many farmable days [cont. on page 2]\n<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Rural District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

Therefore more work must be done on the few fine days that we get and this can only by done by an increased supply of labour.\n\nFor these reasons I think I am entitled to an increased ratio of labour to the area of arable land and amount of stock that is given to those in more favourable districts.\n\nBesides the farm work my carters and horses have to do all the carting necessary for the wood's sawmill and repairs to small holdings and cottages - there are on the Estate 40 holdings for the carting of materials for the repair of which I am liable as the occupiers do not keep a horse or pony.\n\nConsequently on the farm I do not get days when I can employ the carters away from their horses as happens on farms where there is no Estate work to be done.\n\nBesides the 5 men mentioned I have only available for all Estate or Forestry work 1 mason and two woodmen.\n\nIn December and January last I did a considerable amount of sawing for the Cwmystwyth Mine Ltd, this among other sizes entailing the supplying of 4 baulks each 42'x12\"x12\". The timber in the round necessary to produce these dimensions weighing 2.5 tons each so that I had to employ four some times 5men on the work.\n\nDirectly this order was completed I got to work on one for the Lisburne Development Syndicate - viz to supply the contractors timber - sawn square - necessary for the Launders for the new mine at Gwaith Coch - necessitating 14,000 sup ft [super foot] sawing - a great deal of the work being done by the man for whose service I am now appealing.\n\nI am now engaged on sawing a further lot of timber for the same company, the manager of which has asked me to try to supply him with the sawn timber for the whole of the new mill and power house below Grogwinion as well as for another launder. This I have promised to do if I have the necessary labour available on the understanding that I shall not be bound to keep the men sawing every day if I find I can take the men for a big part for haymaking or harvesting.

[super foot]\n\nDuring the past 5 months I have had to fell about 4000 cub [cubic] ft [of] larch for local works - mostly in lots of 50-100 cu [cubic] ft for farmers for fencing posts - for farmers come to me from as far north as Borth - south as Berth and Lledrod, Aberystwyth in the west and Potallog [Bodtalog] in Radnorshire in the east.\n\nAnnually in addition to the timber I sell about 160-200 load of firewood to local persons thus saving the transport of coal and in addition some 250 doz rails to farmers for fencing.\n\nI have recently had to pension off my old joiner who has worked on the Estate for almost 50 years so that practically all joiner work has to be done roughly by one of the sawyers.\n\nOn all the farms on the Estate practically all the fences are composed of post-and-wire - for the supplying of the former I am liable and in this mountainous district a very large number have to be renewed each year.\n\nIn the running of a farm with 64 3/4 acres under the plough - for the sawing urgently needed for Government work for a minimum of estate repairs for work in the woods I do not consider a staff of 8 men and 1 woman excessive.\n\nShould you not be able to reverse the decision of the Local Tribunal in this case - though I should do my best to carry on, some work of urgent national importance must be left undone.\n\nIn July 1914 with less than 1/3 of what is now under the plough and no call whatever for converted timber I employed on  less but similar work 16 men and 1 woman - just double of what I have today.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Rural District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

July 31st 1918\nAberystwyth.\nDear Sir\n\nI beg to support the case of Thomas Davies of Rhydygwin Llanfarian who will appear before your Tribunal on the 2nd proximo. This man has been employed as a Timber Sawyer & Feller with me in the home-grown timber trade since the 19th March 1917 in the neighbourhood of Abermaed. He has worked for me in this trade ever since that date either as a Sawyer or as a Feller with the exception that about two months ago I had to change his employment temporarily to load very heavy timber owing to shortage of extra loaders for such heavy work This man is engaged on timber which is used for colliery purposes as pitwood & he is engaged on work of very great National Importances & I am being pressed to keep up the supplies of Pitwood for the Collieries. I strongly support his case as he is a skilled man & it is impossible to replace him at the present time. Yours faithfully, Per pro\nWALTER BOYNTON \nW.

The said Richard Williams is an expert Mason, and has been in that occupation for over 30 years.  He is foreman and in full charge of the work and having regard to the reduction of staff and work to be done the services  of this Richard Williams are indispensable.  The staffs of all builders and contractors in Aberystwyth have been reduced to a minimum and it is difficult if not impossible at the present time to undertake and complete all the essential work in the District.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberystwyth Rural District<p>Number of Case: 3W<p>Tag: Unknown document type",
