That I did absolutely all the correspondence book keeping etc.  That I was most essential to carry on the business, because the absence of my brother in fixing machinery and engines, and that no one was at home interested in the business.  My object in this Appeal against the decision of the Tribunal that no consideration was made as to time before leaving.  When you consider that my interest in the business is over Â£1500, I think that I am not unreasonable to ask for a month or two to arrange matters between my brother and self, so that I shall have no financial matters to worry me while on my new duties.  I want to ascertain what are my liabilities and the assets, and before arriving at any definite arrangement it will take me a month or two.  I appeal to your honour to grant me one or two months.   <p>Signature of appellant: John Hugh Jones<p>Address of appellant: Compton House Aberayron<p>Occupation, profession or business: Ironmonger and Agricultural Machinery<p>Date: 1916-03-04T00:47:40.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

I used to have a milking cow but was obliged to dispose of it because I could not spare time for tending and milking it.\nI have no servant male or female on the premises but a woman comes in twice and sometimes three times a week to wash &c.\nMy wife is almost entirely occupied with the children, the Kitchen, Commercial room and housework and she gives little attention to the business which I conduct personally.\nI do the cellar work serve at the Bar and tend the cattle and pony without assistance and I am fully occupied.\nI engaged a female servant in November last for the year but she left me in March last and I have not been able to get another servant in her place.  It is difficult to find a maid who can do both house and Bar work.\nThe management of the Public house calls for greater care in these days than ever before and such premises cannot be properly conducted except by a man.\nI am the sole proprietor of the business and the support of my family depends exclusively upon it and it would be quite impossible for me to make arrangements for the carrying on the business in my absence.\nIf I were called upon for Army Service I should have to close the house, sell all the trade effects and lose my livelihood and all the hard-won earnings which I invested in the business.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberaeron Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

He has been a habitual drunkard for many years until about 10 years ago, which together with his bodily weakness has tended to create in his mind suspicious or imaginative impressions which is very vexatious. I therefore submit that it would be a very hard case to seperate the old people from us during their last stage, as I am quite positive my wife could not undertake the charge in my absence.

Number '77' handwritten in top-right corner.<p>Transcription: re DAVID EVANS of Black Lion, Aberayron\n\nI am 36 years old.\n\nI am married with 2 young children aged 17 months and 3 years respectively\n\nMy wife is in ill-health\n\nI married in 1913 and in October of the same year I became licensee of the Black Lion Inn Aberayron where I have resided since.\n\nI had for some years previously been in business as a building contrator in the Rhondda Valley and saved up a considerable amount of money which I invested in my present business.\n\nI gave up business in the Rhondda Valley owing to infirm health and upon medical advice returned to Cardiganshire.\n\nThe Black Lion Inn is the second largest licensed house out of 14 in the town of Aberayron and has always been well conducted.\n\nIt comprises a cellar (in the basement) a Commercial Room, Smoke Room Bar and Kitchen on the ground floor - a Billiard Room and 3 Bed-rooms on the first storey and 5 Bed-rooms on the second storey and there is stabling for 10 horses.\n\nIn addition, I hold some land at Aberayron and usually keep a pony. I used to have a milking cow but was obliged to dispose of it because I could not spare time for tending and milking it.\n\nI have no servant, male or female, on the premises but a woman comes in twice and sometimes three times a week to wash &c, but during the summer season I employ a servant maid.\n\nMy wife is almost entirely occupied with the children and the house-work and she gives little attention to the business which I conduct personally.\n\nI do the cellar work serve at the Bar and tend the pony without assistance and I am fully occupied.\n\nThe management of a public-house calls for greater care in these days than ever before and such premesies cannot be properly conducted except by a man.\n\nI am the sole proprietor of the business and the support of my family depends exclusively upon it and it would be quite impossible for me to make arrangements for the carrying on of the business in my absence.\n\nIf I were called up for Army Service I should have to close the house sell all the trade effects and lose my livelihood and all the hard won earnings which I invested in the business as I cannot dispose of the business under the present conditions - public-house businesses being absolutely unsaleable at the present time.\n\nThere is a good summer season at Aberayron which has not been much affected by the War, the visitors being mostly farmers, and the profits of my business are largest during that season.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberaeron Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

We are also bacon curers, and slaughter and cure over 800 hogs every year. We have to collect the whole of our butter from the depots in various districts and the butter so collected is blended at our Factory at Aberayron. H Lowe is employed by us as a collector and blender of butter and as a bacon curer. As a collector he has charge of large sums of money to pay for the butter at the various depots, and thus holds a position of great trust. He is indispensable to us in our business, which business is of extreme national importance at the present time, when there is such a surplusage of butter in the country. He is a skilled Bacon Curer and an able and industrious worker, and without his services it would be impossible for us to carry o. He is the only person in our employ capable of driving the motor lorry with which we collect the butter at the depots.<p>Tag: Beige R186/187, page 1",
