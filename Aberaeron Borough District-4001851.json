I used to have a milking cow but was obliged to dispose of it because I could not spare time for tending and milking it.\nI have no servant male or female on the premises but a woman comes in twice and sometimes three times a week to wash &c.\nMy wife is almost entirely occupied with the children, the Kitchen, Commercial room and housework and she gives little attention to the business which I conduct personally.\nI do the cellar work serve at the Bar and tend the cattle and pony without assistance and I am fully occupied.\nI engaged a female servant in November last for the year but she left me in March last and I have not been able to get another servant in her place.  It is difficult to find a maid who can do both house and Bar work.\nThe management of the Public house calls for greater care in these days than ever before and such premises cannot be properly conducted except by a man.\nI am the sole proprietor of the business and the support of my family depends exclusively upon it and it would be quite impossible for me to make arrangements for the carrying on the business in my absence.\nIf I were called upon for Army Service I should have to close the house, sell all the trade effects and lose my livelihood and all the hard-won earnings which I invested in the business.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberaeron Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4001851/canvas/4001895.json#xywh=0,0,3605,5464",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberaeron Borough/Urban District<p>Name: David Evans <p>Address: Black Lion Inn Aberayron <p>Occupation, profession or business: Licensed Victualler <p>Attested or not attested: Attested <p>Grounds: (a) I am 35 years of age\n(b) I am married with two children aged respectively 6 months and 2 years \n(c) I am the License of the Black Lion Inn Aberayron and sole proprietor of the business carried on therein which includes the provision of accomodation for travellers and viistors.\n(d) My wife is in ill-health and her time is almost entirely occupied with the children and household work. \n(e) I have no servant.\n(f) The support of my family exclusively depends upon the business.\n(g) If called up for Army Service I shall be obliged to close the business and to realise my stock-in-trade and effects <p>Signature of appellant: David Evans<p>Date: 1916-07-18T09:05:49.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4001851/canvas/4001896.json#xywh=0,0,3603,5439",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reason for decision of Local Tribunal: 1.

Number '77' handwritten in top-right corner.<p>Transcription: re DAVID EVANS of Black Lion, Aberayron\n\nI am 36 years old.\n\nI am married with 2 young children aged 17 months and 3 years respectively\n\nMy wife is in ill-health\n\nI married in 1913 and in October of the same year I became licensee of the Black Lion Inn Aberayron where I have resided since.\n\nI had for some years previously been in business as a building contrator in the Rhondda Valley and saved up a considerable amount of money which I invested in my present business.\n\nI gave up business in the Rhondda Valley owing to infirm health and upon medical advice returned to Cardiganshire.\n\nThe Black Lion Inn is the second largest licensed house out of 14 in the town of Aberayron and has always been well conducted.\n\nIt comprises a cellar (in the basement) a Commercial Room, Smoke Room Bar and Kitchen on the ground floor - a Billiard Room and 3 Bed-rooms on the first storey and 5 Bed-rooms on the second storey and there is stabling for 10 horses.\n\nIn addition, I hold some land at Aberayron and usually keep a pony. I used to have a milking cow but was obliged to dispose of it because I could not spare time for tending and milking it.\n\nI have no servant, male or female, on the premises but a woman comes in twice and sometimes three times a week to wash &c, but during the summer season I employ a servant maid.\n\nMy wife is almost entirely occupied with the children and the house-work and she gives little attention to the business which I conduct personally.\n\nI do the cellar work serve at the Bar and tend the pony without assistance and I am fully occupied.\n\nThe management of a public-house calls for greater care in these days than ever before and such premesies cannot be properly conducted except by a man.\n\nI am the sole proprietor of the business and the support of my family depends exclusively upon it and it would be quite impossible for me to make arrangements for the carrying on of the business in my absence.\n\nIf I were called up for Army Service I should have to close the house sell all the trade effects and lose my livelihood and all the hard won earnings which I invested in the business as I cannot dispose of the business under the present conditions - public-house businesses being absolutely unsaleable at the present time.\n\nThere is a good summer season at Aberayron which has not been much affected by the War, the visitors being mostly farmers, and the profits of my business are largest during that season.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberaeron Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4001851/canvas/4001987.json#xywh=0,0,3430,5372",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Aberaeron Borough/Urban District<p>Name: David Evans <p>Age: 36 <p>Married or single: Married <p>Date of marriage: 1913-03-26T09:56:07.000Z<p>Address: Black Lion, Aberayron<p>Address at date of National Registration: Same<p>Where attested: Lampeter <p>Date of attestation: 1915-12-10T14:58:45.000Z<p>Number of group: 40<p>Number on group card: 32 <p>Occupation, profession or business: Innkeeper <p>Name of employer: Himself<p>Address: Aberayron <p>Grounds: (a) (d) <p>Nature of application: For Certificate of Exemption (conditional) <p>Tag: Blue R52/53, page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4001851/canvas/4001988.json#xywh=0,0,3462,5373",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reasons in support of the application: See annexed sheet<p>Whether any previous application has been made: Yes (a) on 22nd March 1917 (b) by applicant (c) County Tribunal (d) Temporary Exemption granted for 3 months (open)<p>Signature: David Evans<p>Date: 1917-06-14T09:52:54.000Z<p>Decision of Tribunal: Temporary exemption until September 30th 1917 and not to be renewed except on an application to be made with the leave of this Tribunal.

Born 16th March.  Single.  I am in partnership with my Mother who is 60 years old as Ironmonger and General Stores.  I was orgininally a Carpenter until nine years ago when I had to give up my then trade to come home to assist my mother who would otherwise have had to give up the business, as my brother (18 years of age) who until then assisted my mother, left to join the Merchant Service.  Since then I have managed the business and do all the ordering of the goods.  \n\nI presented myself for attestation on December 13th 1913 at Lampeter and was pronounced medically unift.  I was called up for re-examination on 4th September 1914 and was again rejected by Recruiting Medical Board at Carmarthen.  On the 12th May 1917 I was again examined by Medical Board at Carmarthen and put in Class III.  \n\nOn the 10th March 1918 I was examined by a Medical Board at Carmarthen and again put in C. III.  I was before the Local Tribunal at Aberayron on 17th August 1917 and obtained Conditionl exemption.  On 4th May 1918 I was again before the Local Tribunal and had exemption for three months.  \n\nFor the last four years I have suffered from severe attacks of kidney trouble and during those 4 years I have been constantly under treatment for that complaint by Dr D.M. Davies, M.D. Aberayron.
