I believe that international disputes could be settled without the shedding of blood.  However, I am patriotic and I should like to do something short of taking life for my country.   I understand that mine sweeping is dangerous and that men are wanted in that sphere.  \n\nI am ready  gentlemen, to undertake such work but it will create great hardship, indeed.  I do not know what is to become of my invalid mother. It will mean very serious hardship to her as I have to pay a woman to nurse her, and I cannot do so if I am not exempted.  I have incurred debts during ill health in college, so I am already in financial difficulties.  \n\nI am preaching almost every Sunday and it is only with the remuneration I get, plus my salary that I can keep the home fires burning.\n\nYours faithfully,   T.

The present staff on the farm is my son (whose conditional exemption have expired on the first of this month) (the previous phrase in brackets was crossed out) and two servants, one being the man in question and a small boy of 15 years small of his age and unable to do much work with the horses except harrowing together with two daughters and a grand-daughter<p>Name of Tribunal: Dosbarth Gwledig Aberteifi<p>Number of Case: 176<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

So under the present circumstances I claim that it is in the national interest the man should continue in his present employment and in support of my contention I beg to draw your attention to the present state of agriculture in the district viz the scarcity of labour as well as the backwardness of the season. Most farmers have not half finished putting their crops in owing to the unfavourable weather of the past and present season and if many more young men from the district will be called up the farming industry will be undermined with the result that the food supply of the nation must suffer as without available labour the land cannot be tilled for the production of crops. I wish also to point to you the hardship and inconvenience as well as financial loss the farmers are put into owing to the men being called up at this time of the year, generally the agreement between the farmer and his servant is an annual agreement that is to say from November to November. So the first half year have expired and the point of issue is whether it is right for the farmer to pay the half year's salary in full to the servant on leaving or whether he is justified in deducting some amount from his salary on account of the different value of the respective half years to the farmer. \nYours E Williams<p>Name of Tribunal: Cardigan Rural District<p>Number of Case: 176<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I was refused exemption by the County Tribunal on the appeal of the Military Representative although it is important to note that the Local [underlined] Tribunal granted me Conditional [underlined] Exemption [underlined].

The business in which I have invested my entire savings, is under my sole direction.  My aged father and mother are dependent on me and I am their only child.\nIt is highly important to bear in mind what would be the effect on my business, and how the people of Llechryd & my aged parents would suffer.   I have a small Grocer's & Confectionery shop & a considerable stock of Goods.  My annual turnover is considerable. I emphatically  state that if the Appeal Tribunal consider my father is able to conduct the business, they are, I am sorry to say,  labouring under a big delusion.\nThe question is a serious one. I am fully engaged in my work all the year round as the public can testify.  I ask your consent, Gentlemen to appeal again to be treated more fairly as there is no doubt  the hardships that will follow  if I am taken, will be very great.\n  If you do not consider I am entitled to conditional exemption after placing the facts before you may I beg of you to grant me a few months (say 6 months) to put matters in order and to arrange for the comfort of my parents under present circumstances.\n                                  I am Gentlemen,\n                                          Your obedt.

All the cattle are kept indoors from the middle of November untill the middle of April, (which means much more Labour) as the land is too wet for the cattle to be turned out even in day time, all the straw has to be chaffed before it could be consumed; All the Stock are sold Fat. The two lads that are employed Sydney Ashman & Peter Jones are fully employed by feeding the Cattle, the Chaffing have to be done by others, Sydney Ashman has been rejected by the Army, and is going home to London in November, there were about  80 acres arable and about 104 acres Hay this year. Having sold between 30 & 40 tons Hay to the Army, & signed an agreement to cart same to the Station. According to the agreement made between the Board of Agriculture & the War Office this farm is already understaffed, I believe it would be unfair to take another man from this farm unless you are ready to replace same   by a practicable intelligible man, as it is out of the question for me to find another man.

(2). That my father is a subtenant of the tenant of Dyffryn Farm and under his tenancy agreement he has undertaken to give his service to his landlord on Dyffryn Farm but now in consequence of his old age and infirmity he is unable to fulfil his obligation and it devolves upon me to do so.

Previous to the War I had in my Employ three men, one joined the Army at the outbreak of the War; the other has failed through old age and the other a young man of 21 years again left on the 10 Nov last to join the Colours. The man in question has been in my Employ for several months past and since the 10 Nov  he is the only able bodied and experienced hand I have as besides him I have only a boy about 16 years and my son who is under 17. My son is only able to do very light work and often unable to do any work on account of the effects of a severe attack of pneumonia which he had  a short time ago. My Farm is 188 acres in Extent, 49 of which are kept under corn and 40 under hay. I Keep three pairs of horses and he is the only man I have to manage them. His services are therefore indispensable to me and in the face of the governments call upon Farmers to do their utmost to rear a larger stock of cattle and to cultivate  their land with the View of producing as much as possible of wheat barley and other agricultural produce it is most expedient in the National Interest that he should instead of being Employed in Military Service be allowed to remain in my Service. Besides he is in reach of his fathers home and thus able to go home to sleep and to do the necessary Attendance upon his aged Father who is 84 years of age and in feeble health<p>Whether any previous application has been made: Yes to appeal Tribunal (County) jointly with the Man & on the last occasion it was dismissed on the understanding that he was not to be called  until the 1st May but since that time the circumstances have completely altered as the above facts show and a re hearing has been granted.<p>Signature: Benjamin Jones<p>Date: 1916-12-27T19:13:41.000Z<p>Decision of Tribunal: That the man be exempted from being called up for Military Service The exemption is conditional on his remaining inx the occupationin which he is habitually engaged on the ground that it is expedient in the National Interests that the man should instead of being employed in Military Service be engaged in other work in which he is habitually engaged.\nL.

My stock consists of 6 working horses (3 teams) and 6 young horses, 20 milch cows 35 young cattle 20 breeding ewes 3 breeding sows and 17 pigs. The labor on the farm consists of myself (37 years of age) Arthur Edgley (35), Ivor Rees (17) and  ? Jones 15 My sister Hannah Evans (35) and two young girls of 16 and 15 respectively. Part of my farm is situate on a slope and it requires a strong person to plough it and the reaping of a great portion has to be done with a scythe. Another part of the farm is heavy land and consequently very laborious. The local tribunal decided that the man Edgley should work 3 days a week on some other farms in the district. If I am deprived of his services for 3 days a week it will be impossible for me to cultivate the quantity of land intended as the two boys cannot do my work.

A substitute would be absolutely useless, unless he is a man who will live on and remain constantly on the premises. \nBeing a woman and advancing in years, and in a poor & feeble state of health.  I must rely on a  good and reliable man to carry on the work of the farm and in this sense  Evan  Davies is most indispensable because he works on the farm day in & day out.\nThe facts in support of my claim are: acreage of farm A 120, A 3/4 under corn, A 20 in Hay\n2 pairs working Horses, 4 others, 30 cattle, 40 ewes & lambs + other stock.

I should be very thankfull if you could arrange in order to exempt me from coming before the County Tribunal at Aberystwyth on Friday the 15th inst re. Oliver Davies.   Being that my dear husband passed away on the 3rd of this month, I have no man, or boy, to carry on the work on the farm and being that my husband was bad for a long time, the ploughing etc.  has been held back therefore it will be very inconvenient for me to let Oliver come, and my feelings are too much to be explained in words.  I beg to state that the acreage of the farm is 16. Under the plough= 16. Horses =2,  Cattle etc =12, Pigs =4.   Also I beg to state that Oliver has been exempted by the \"Local Tribunal\" for a month in order to find work on a farm and he has agreed to work for me as my servant, and is already in my employ, he is actually ploughing at present, and as I stated above, it will be a great loss to lose one day, as the work is far behind.<p>Name of Tribunal: Unknown<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I beg to state that he was granted conditional exemption by the appeal tribunal on 6th July 1917 by which he was to assist in farm work during four days in the week. Since then he has always been most obedient to respond to the call of the farmers of the district. His mother being a widow in advanced age is depending in him to carry on the work on her small farm. His two brothers have voluntarily joined the colours at the outbreak of war. Having now had experience in farm work he is now desirous to continue in the same. I beg also to call your attention to the fact that he is placed in Grade 3. I greatly trust that you can arrange to continue his conditional exemption on the same lines as before\nI remain yours faithfully\nD Evans Trewen<p>Name of Tribunal: Cardiganshire/Cardigan County<p>Tag: Unknown document type",
