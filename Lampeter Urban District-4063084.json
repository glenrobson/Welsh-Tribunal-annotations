They seem to be the total area of the land that is ever so treated.\n(3) The farm is quite near the town of Lampeter, and it would not be difficult to get help in haymaking at least.

During the months that ensued till my discharge in March 1916 - the business was seriously injured as People bought at the shop when cobbling could also be done - but owing to my widowed mother failing to receive any substitute - the business dwindled and when I came home the business was seriously handicapped.  I respectfully wish to point out that I am the sole support of my widowed mother - and that I have a full-stock of boots & shoes etc and as I have previously pointed out - without anyone to do the cobbling - the business will be at a stand still as could be easily proved by reference to the trade done during my absence after my father's death.

Lampeter, relating to appeal for Lewis Lloyd<p>Transcription: 9th September 1916\n\nDear, Sir,\n\nI am instructed by Mr Thomas Davies, Teify Forge, Drovers Road Lampeter to ask the Appeal Tribunal for leave to apply for a renewal of the certificate of exemption granted to his workman Lewis Lloyd, on the 7th day of July last, and in support of the application beg to lay the following facts before the Tribunal:\nThis is the only man employed by Mr Davies, and he has the shoeing of horses for about 55 farmers in the district, and about 30 horses in town. He also does the repairs to all kinds of agricultural machinery and implements. He cannot possibly carry on this work himself, and he cannot get anyone to replace this man. He is 56 years of age, and although he is capable of doing work, and -is- working every day, he will be quite unable to carry on the smithy as at present without the services of this man, as the strain would be too severe, and Mr Davies suffers from pains in the back and weak eyes.\nThere is only one other smithy in the town, and my client is made to understand that the proprietor  has quite enough to do to attend to his own customers.   <p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 20<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063084/canvas/4063174.json#xywh=0,0,3368,4124",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Letter to tribunal.

The decision however was confirmed by you with the variation that no further appeal should be made without the consent of the County Appeal Tribunal, and I beg, sirs, to be allowed to ask you now for that consent. With your permission, I will briefly recall to your minds the leading facts of the case and point out to you the hardship that would ensue if he was called up, not only to me but to the farmers of the district. We work for 59 farms and of these 41 have four horses or over. Many of the farmers have gone in for heavy horses and it is impossible for one smith to shoe them. Furthermore mechanics are also scarce that during the week we are often called away several times to put some machine or other, which the farmers use, in order. \nI may be allowed to state that there is only one other forge in Lampeter and district for a radius of from five to seven miles with a single exception in one direction. During the last 25 years 10 smithys have closed down in this district and this will explain to you the accumulation of work at this forge, and I may add that I am a R.S.S. and have taken prices in shoeing and other competitions in the leading shows <p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063084/canvas/4063182.json#xywh=0,0,3432,5300",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Correspondence to the Tribunal.

Other stores in town when the heir of the business is alive, have been granted Conditional Exemption for men of military age, while I myself being a one-man-business proprietor is called away, leaving my business to go to ruin and leaving my mother a widow unsupported.<p>Signature of appellant: Tom Jones<p>Address of appellant: 20 Bridge Street Lampeter<p>Date: 1916-10-19T10:30:57.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063084/canvas/4063222.json#xywh=0,0,3564,5560",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reason for decision of Local Tribunal: That the hardship was not so great as to justify the exemption of a man already trained, and probably able to do valuable work in the army. \nHugh Walker \nOct 25 1916<p>Decision: That the man be exempted from the provisions of the Military Service Act 1916, the exemption is temporary viz for two calendar months, on the ground that it is expedient in the national interests that the man should instead of being employed in Military service be engaged in other work in whch he is habitually engaged during the above mentioned period. \nDecember 1st 1916. \nJohn Jones \nChairman<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 2",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063084/canvas/4063223.json#xywh=0,0,3588,5564",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Name of Local Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 40M<p>Name: Thomas Jones<p>Age: 29   1887<p>Married or single: Single<p>Address: 20 Bridge Street Lampeter<p>Address at date of National Registration: Army<p>Occupation, profession or business: Shoemaker & Repairer<p>Precise occupation before 15 August 1915: Yes<p>Length of occupation before 15 August 1915: Since Boyhood<p>Grounds: d.<p>Nature of application: Temporary Exemption<p>Tag: Beige R41/42: Page 1",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063084/canvas/4063224.json#xywh=0,0,3588,5564",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Reasons: I am a time expired man having been in the army seven years being discharged on 2nd of March 1916. When I was called up for service on outbreak of hostilities my father was alive and able to look after the business. But in Ap. 1915 my mother was left a widow and she is unable to attend to ordering and Book keeping owing to her having had such a little schooling. Furthermore there is no one to do any repairing, and without a Repairer a Boot and Shoe stores can do but little trade and in order to show the loss sustained owing to my absence, I append a financial statement: 1914 the turnover was \u00a3526. 1915 \u00a3447. 1916 \u00a3195. The smallness of 1916 is due to the fact that the busiest part of the season is during the Winter and early Spring months. Since my discharge I have received stock worth \u00a3352-2-8 and have given orders which have not yet been executed for a further sum of \u00a3200. I may explain this by a circular received from the firms that orders should be placed early in order that they might be executed during relief from army work. Furthermore I have book debts drawing close on \u00a3200. I am also the only son of a widow, and had I not been a time expired man my business would come under the band of one-man business. If I am called away, the business would simply be ruined.<p>Previous applications: Yes I myself.

My mother is an invalid & requires the constant attention of my sister. Father, mother & sister as well as my wife and myself are entirely dependent on the business as their means of support. The work in connection with the business is very heavy as I have to carry and handle in the course of a year well over 2,000 sacks of grain & flour. An important part of the business is the supplying to farmers of wheat, oats & barley for seed & in this branch we have been very successful every year in securing good seed & we have a large number of farmers who depend on us every year for spring & winter sowing.\nI have to carry on the business almost single handed & am responsible for the buying, stock keeping, selling & book keeping & some of the heavier goods I have to deliver personally to the town customers.

I have two sons serving with the Colours and we is somewhere in France.  Since the commencement of hostilities five men have left me to join the colours.  I have advertised seven times and have received only two applications.  One left me after a short time owing to kidney disease.  The other was of no use, having been rejected by the army owing to hip disease.  At present I have only him assisting me.  He was exempted until the last Review of cases owing to his being in a certified occupation.  He has been before the Medical Board recently and was classed as B ii.  I may say that the call for work by the farmers becomes more pressing daily.  I have four new carts and six pairs of wheels promised and recommenced besides daily calls for whipple trees and axle trees and other minor jobs which have to be attended to immediately or the farmer is thrown out of work.  During the week many calls for attendance at farms to remedy some defect in machinery come, so that in the truest sense of the term I believe we are doing extremely important national work.  I only wish to draw your attention to the great expense I have put myself into in order to fit my workshop proper to cope with the demands upon me, and to the serious hardship which would ensue both financially and otherwise should he be called up.  Seeing he is only classed in B II,  I hope you will consider the claims of the former sufficiently urgent and important to warrant his being conditionally exempted.<p>Whether any previous application has been made: Yes.

This is the only one I have at present and I have failed to find a substitute for I have advertised seven times with only two applications and those from men suffering from kidney disease and hip disease.  My own health is far from good and it would be impossible for me to replace him as he is able also to do the smith's work.  I have two sons serving with the colours and he is only classed in B II.  I would wish to draw your attention to Mem.

I came to live in Lampeter with my wife and child on April 1st 1914 with a view to taking my degree in preparation for Holy Orders.  Owing to the increased cost of living I find that I am in debt in cash to the extent of \u00a3175, this for the most part owing to the increased cost of living.  In the event of being called to the army great hardship would ensue. Since coming to Lampeter I have spent in all over \u00a3300  about one half of which is money which I had saved only by great care.  I appeal entirely on the grounds of financial hardship and the loss of my three years efforts.  Under ordinary circumstances it will take me a considerable time to pay my debts but if called to the army my difficulties will be much enhanced.

Reasons in support of the application by Timothy Eric Richards, Cedar Bank, College St, Lampeter<p>Transcription: I repeat the grounds stated in my previous application made to the Local Tribunal at Lampeter. Additional grounds now are that the turnover in my business has greatly increased and the total amount of my sales and repairs now amounts approximately to \u00a38000 a year. \nMy business has become a much more important one than it was in 1916, both in respect of value to me and in respect of importance in respect of essential home needs.\nI have purchased on behalf of customers two new sets of steam traction and threshing tackle which are to be delivered in August. These and numerous other engines (including about 90 agricultural oil engines fitted by me) will be under my care and attention and this work and that of repairing agricultural machinery fully occupy my time.\nOn the average I have about \u00a3 600 owing to me by debtors. At the customary time for payment of accounts in my trade in August I shall have some thousands of pounds to pay for agricultural machinery. \nI am the only agricultural fitter and engineer in the Lampeter district of the County, and the farmers in this large area depend upon me for expert assistance with their machinery.

Dalis Cabinet Works. Lampeter.<p>Transcription: I am 39 years of age, grade 2, and married with two children. I started in business 10 years ago, with very little capital, and after a hard struggle managed to work up a good connection. Before the War I had five hands. They have all gone to the Army or to aeroplane works, and I have no one now. I am a cabinet maker, undertaker and do a lot of house jobbing. Before the War there were 5 proprietors of cabinet works and 25 workmen in the town. Now there are only 4 proprietors and two workmen. Lampeter supplies a wide district. I am now full up with orders and have not taken any new orders for three months. I have enough to keep me fully employed up to next May. A few months before the war broke out I expended a lot of money on new buildings, plant and machinery. A great deal of my money is sunk in these, and I have not had an opportunity of getting it back. My liabilities at present amount to about \u00a3225 , and I have to pay in rent rates and taxes about \u00a320 a year. I hold a lease of the premises with six years to run and have about \u00a3100 worth of raw materials on my hand now. I have no one to carry on the business in my absence, as I have to manufacture all the goods I sell. I would therefore have to close down.<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 317 Review A86<p>Tag: Unknown document type",                "format": "text/plain"            }        },        {            "@type": "oa:Annotation",            "motivation": "sc:painting",            "on": "https://damsssl.llgc.org.uk/iiif/2.0/4063084/canvas/4063380.json#xywh=0,0,2236,3332",            "resource": {                "@type": "cnt:ContentAsText",                "chars": "Description: Letter from Lampeter Town Clerk enclosing appeal from James Davies, 56 Bridge Street Lampeter <p>Transcription: Borough of Lampeter, Town Clerk's Office, Lampeter,\n12th September 1918\nDear Sir\nAppeal Tribunal\nI enclose herewith a notice of Appeal from the decision of the Lampeter Borough Tribunal, in respect of James Davies, 56 Bridge Street Lampeter (Review A.86).\nYours faithfully,\nJ.
