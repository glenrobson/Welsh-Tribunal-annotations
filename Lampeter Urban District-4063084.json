I farm 170 acres, 20 acres of which is arable land. The man referred to is the only man, employed by me on the farm and he does the ploughing, carting, and all necessary team work. In addition to farming, I have about 65 head of cattle, 11 horses and about 35 breeding Ewes. I also carry on an extensive dairy business which is very expensive, a boy of 18 is solely employed, in that business and he has to be assisted by a small boy, who is leaving school this week. 25 Cows have to be milked night and morning all the year round. I have also 55 acres of Meadow Hay which entails a great deal of labour, especially with the conflicting weather we have to contend with. The average sum that I am called to pay per year is about £600 & my honest opinion is that justice cannot be done with this farm, unless you grant me one man.<p>Signature of appellant: Thomas Davies<p>Address of appellant: Pontfaen  Lampeter<p>Occupation, profession or business: Farmer<p>Why appellant acts for the man: Necessity <p>Date: 1916-03-11T05:53:55.000Z<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

They seem to be the total area of the land that is ever so treated.\n(3) The farm is quite near the town of Lampeter, and it would not be difficult to get help in haymaking at least.

Men in this category are only fifth in importance.\n(2). The large garden which I have requires a lot of work in order that I may get all I can out of it, as the ground where the potatoes &c are now taken from has to be prepared and planted with other crops in rotation for the purpose of getting crops during the winter.\n(3).

Lampeter, relating to appeal for Lewis Lloyd<p>Transcription: 9th September 1916\n\nDear, Sir,\n\nI am instructed by Mr Thomas Davies, Teify Forge, Drovers Road Lampeter to ask the Appeal Tribunal for leave to apply for a renewal of the certificate of exemption granted to his workman Lewis Lloyd, on the 7th day of July last, and in support of the application beg to lay the following facts before the Tribunal:\nThis is the only man employed by Mr Davies, and he has the shoeing of horses for about 55 farmers in the district, and about 30 horses in town. He also does the repairs to all kinds of agricultural machinery and implements. He cannot possibly carry on this work himself, and he cannot get anyone to replace this man. He is 56 years of age, and although he is capable of doing work, and -is- working every day, he will be quite unable to carry on the smithy as at present without the services of this man, as the strain would be too severe, and Mr Davies suffers from pains in the back and weak eyes.\nThere is only one other smithy in the town, and my client is made to understand that the proprietor  has quite enough to do to attend to his own customers.   <p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 20<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

For a radius of five miles with a single exception in one direction there is no other forge with the exception of the one at Lampeter. During the last twenty years ten smithys have been closed with the result that the work has greatly increased. Farmers have gone in for heavy horses which is impossible for one to manage. The land or district is of a stony nature and the farmers use iron ploughshares which one cannot forge owing to scarcity of mechanics and the large number of machines used by farmers nowadays one of us is frequently called away to do repairs, thus saving valuable time for the farmers, but it would be impossible if he was called away to leave the forge unattended, The farmers of the district have petitioned you to let them retain his services for he has been apprenticed to me as Registrar Shewing Smith and I may add that I have taken prizes in some of the leading shows of England + Wales.<p>Previous applications: Yes (a) on 29 June 1916 (b) by me (c) to Local Tribunal who granted temporary exemption to 26 Sept 1916. The military authorities appealed against this decision and on 27 July 1916 the Appeal Tribunal confirmed the decision of the Local Tribunal but with the condition that there was to be no further appeal without leave of the Appeal Tribunal.

The decision however was confirmed by you with the variation that no further appeal should be made without the consent of the County Appeal Tribunal, and I beg, sirs, to be allowed to ask you now for that consent. With your permission, I will briefly recall to your minds the leading facts of the case and point out to you the hardship that would ensue if he was called up, not only to me but to the farmers of the district. We work for 59 farms and of these 41 have four horses or over. Many of the farmers have gone in for heavy horses and it is impossible for one smith to shoe them. Furthermore mechanics are also scarce that during the week we are often called away several times to put some machine or other, which the farmers use, in order. \nI may be allowed to state that there is only one other forge in Lampeter and district for a radius of from five to seven miles with a single exception in one direction. During the last 25 years 10 smithys have closed down in this district and this will explain to you the accumulation of work at this forge, and I may add that I am a R.S.S. and have taken prices in shoeing and other competitions in the leading shows <p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

When I was called up for service on outbreak of hostilities my father was alive and able to look after the business. But in Ap. 1915 my mother was left a widow and she is unable to attend to ordering and Book keeping owing to her having had such a little schooling. Furthermore there is no one to do any repairing, and without a Repairer a Boot and Shoe stores can do but little trade and in order to show the loss sustained owing to my absence, I append a financial statement: 1914 the turnover was £526. 1915 £447. 1916 £195. The smallness of 1916 is due to the fact that the busiest part of the season is during the Winter and early Spring months. Since my discharge I have received stock worth £352-2-8 and have given orders which have not yet been executed for a further sum of £200. I may explain this by a circular received from the firms that orders should be placed early in order that they might be executed during relief from army work. Furthermore I have book debts drawing close on £200. I am also the only son of a widow, and had I not been a time expired man my business would come under the band of one-man business. If I am called away, the business would simply be ruined.<p>Previous applications: Yes I myself.

My mother is an invalid & requires the constant attention of my sister. Father, mother & sister as well as my wife and myself are entirely dependent on the business as their means of support. The work in connection with the business is very heavy as I have to carry and handle in the course of a year well over 2,000 sacks of grain & flour. An important part of the business is the supplying to farmers of wheat, oats & barley for seed & in this branch we have been very successful every year in securing good seed & we have a large number of farmers who depend on us every year for spring & winter sowing.\nI have to carry on the business almost single handed & am responsible for the buying, stock keeping, selling & book keeping & some of the heavier goods I have to deliver personally to the town customers. It would be impossible for the business to be carried on in my absence & if I were called to serve in the army we should have no option but to close up the shop which would be a great hardship to my parents whose health is already impaired<p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 42<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I have two sons serving with the Colours and we is somewhere in France.  Since the commencement of hostilities five men have left me to join the colours.  I have advertised seven times and have received only two applications.  One left me after a short time owing to kidney disease.  The other was of no use, having been rejected by the army owing to hip disease.  At present I have only him assisting me.  He was exempted until the last Review of cases owing to his being in a certified occupation.  He has been before the Medical Board recently and was classed as B ii.  I may say that the call for work by the farmers becomes more pressing daily.  I have four new carts and six pairs of wheels promised and recommenced besides daily calls for whipple trees and axle trees and other minor jobs which have to be attended to immediately or the farmer is thrown out of work.  During the week many calls for attendance at farms to remedy some defect in machinery come, so that in the truest sense of the term I believe we are doing extremely important national work.  I only wish to draw your attention to the great expense I have put myself into in order to fit my workshop proper to cope with the demands upon me, and to the serious hardship which would ensue both financially and otherwise should he be called up.  Seeing he is only classed in B II,  I hope you will consider the claims of the former sufficiently urgent and important to warrant his being conditionally exempted.<p>Whether any previous application has been made: Yes.  He has been conditionally exempted by the Local Tribunal since the 10th of March 1916, owing to his being in a certified occupation.

Owing to breakdown in my father's health & his inability to carry on the work I was obliged to give up a good position in a large London store to conduct & carry on the business in his place. We carry on business as Grocers & Corn & Flour Merchants & the work in connection with the same is exceptionally heavy & involves the carrying & handing of over 2,000 sacks of grain & flour in the course of a year & this work I have to do single handed.\nBesides serving customers & delivering a certain proportion of the heavy goods I have to do the buying, stock-keeping & book-keeping. Owing to ill health in the family I have to work under great strain in order to cope with the work which takes up all my time from early morning until late at night. Besides my wife & myself there are also dependent on the business father & mother (both infirm) & sister. If I were called up for military service serious hardship would ensue as it would be impossible to carry on the business in my absence.\nI have been classified B.1 by the medical board & being unfit for general service & as I am already performing valuable service in supplying the need of the public and taking into consideration my exceptional business obligations & that I shall soon be in my fortieth year I maintain that it is in the national interest that I should remain in Civil life.  <p>Name of Tribunal: Lampeter Borough/Urban District<p>Number of Case: 54<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I came to live in Lampeter with my wife and child on April 1st 1914 with a view to taking my degree in preparation for Holy Orders.  Owing to the increased cost of living I find that I am in debt in cash to the extent of £175, this for the most part owing to the increased cost of living.  In the event of being called to the army great hardship would ensue. Since coming to Lampeter I have spent in all over £300  about one half of which is money which I had saved only by great care.  I appeal entirely on the grounds of financial hardship and the loss of my three years efforts.  Under ordinary circumstances it will take me a considerable time to pay my debts but if called to the army my difficulties will be much enhanced.

I was at my request further examined by a medical Board at Carmarthen on the 25th July 1918 and at first was again graded II I appealed to the Chairman of the Board who after reading the medical certificates copies of which are hereunto annexed and correcting the error in my age, he wrote a fresh certificate placing  me in grade II (BII) notwithstanding the fact that as certified by the certificate of Dr Ellis my physical condition appears to be and I know is worse than it was when I was rejected in the year 1916.\n10.

Reasons in support of the application by Timothy Eric Richards, Cedar Bank, College St, Lampeter<p>Transcription: I repeat the grounds stated in my previous application made to the Local Tribunal at Lampeter. Additional grounds now are that the turnover in my business has greatly increased and the total amount of my sales and repairs now amounts approximately to £8000 a year. \nMy business has become a much more important one than it was in 1916, both in respect of value to me and in respect of importance in respect of essential home needs.\nI have purchased on behalf of customers two new sets of steam traction and threshing tackle which are to be delivered in August. These and numerous other engines (including about 90 agricultural oil engines fitted by me) will be under my care and attention and this work and that of repairing agricultural machinery fully occupy my time.\nOn the average I have about £ 600 owing to me by debtors. At the customary time for payment of accounts in my trade in August I shall have some thousands of pounds to pay for agricultural machinery. \nI am the only agricultural fitter and engineer in the Lampeter district of the County, and the farmers in this large area depend upon me for expert assistance with their machinery.

I started in business 10 years ago, with very little capital, and after a hard struggle managed to work up a good connection. Before the War I had five hands. They have all gone to the Army or to aeroplane works, and I have no one now. I am a cabinet maker, undertaker and do a lot of house jobbing. Before the War there were 5 proprietors of cabinet works and 25 workmen in the town. Now there are only 4 proprietors and two workmen. Lampeter supplies a wide district. I am now full up with orders and have not taken any new orders for three months. I have enough to keep me fully employed up to next May. A few months before the war broke out I expended a lot of money on new buildings, plant and machinery. A great deal of my money is sunk in these, and I have not had an opportunity of getting it back. My liabilities at present amount to about £225 , and I have to pay in rent rates and taxes about £20 a year. I hold a lease of the premises with six years to run and have about £100 worth of raw materials on my hand now. I have no one to carry on the business in my absence, as I have to manufacture all the goods I sell.
