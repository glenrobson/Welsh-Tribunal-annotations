I sell large quantity of wheat and other corn every year. I keep 17 - 20 horses. 50 cattle. 80 ewe sheep. 30 pigs. 3 breeding sows. My son Alun J Jones in respect of whom I make this appeal has just had his 19. He is one out of three  working on the farm. Another English boy of 18 who was in my service, left me a month ago. I offered him £15 for staying, but he had determined to go and work in the ammunition works. I wrote several letters to Industrial schools and elsewhere in search of another one, but hitherto failed to get one.  I have only one daughter and a girl of 13 working as females. The said Alun J Jones appealed for exemption under the military service act, but was rejected by the local Tribunal on the grounds that I got another son in college at Bala Bangor. I beg to state as regards this boy Simon Jones that he is absolutely unfit for any kind of manual labour, to which a medical certificate  will be produced. He was warned by doctors to abandon any kind of work. He met with an accident 4 years ago in a ship by falling in to the hold. He had a compound fracture in one thigh, a fracture in the other knee, got his eye affected through it, was lain up for 4 months in hospital in Buenos Ayres. He has to keep one heel in pad and is under medicine ever since. If I am not allowed to keep three men on this large farm, there is no hesitation I'll have to give the farm up and quit. My other son Evan G Jones 24 was only allowed temporary exemption which is to me inexplicable.<p>Signature of appellant: Mary Jones<p>Address of appellant: Cilie Farm Cross Inn SO.

Magdalen Jones, the occupier 60 years of age being a reumatic cripple, is at times totally incapable of any work. She is therefore  wholly dependent on me for all the work that's to be done on the place and consequently if I was to go away she would be placed in a very difficult position. The cultivation of the holding as it is, does not yield enough profit so as to pay for hired labour, which would be impossible to get in our neighbourhood. Therefore the only possible solution would be to sell out and vacate the place, which would mean our ruin.\nAlso about two years ago , in order to cultvate our farm to a better advantage I took on the responsibility of ploughing and sowing a neighbours farm, and in return I get the loan of their pair of horses to do all the necessary work  on our place, and now owing to the scarcity of labourers in the district, I am the only male person in both places.  In consequence of my aunts infirmity, all the work of feeding our cattle, milking atc. at times falls on me, in addition to general outdoor work, ploughing, sowing, harvesting etc. If hard work on a farm is expedient to the national interest, I honestly believe I ought to secure an absolute exemption. My case being rather complicated I have explained to the best of my ability, but any other possible information will be readily submitted, and any inquiry to the circumstances will be openly admitted.   \n<p>Signature: William E Baker<p>Address: Brynbeddau, Bethania, Llanon, Cards.<p>Occupation, profession or business: Farmer<p>Why application made by applicant for the man: Man<p>Date of application: 1916-02-18T15:39:50.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: Application refused   E James Price  17 MAR 1916<p>Tag: Beige R41/42: Page 2",

They mustant count me as I am over age = 78 and cannot work at all. And the House boy is only 15 years of age is not doing nothing on the Land but assisting my daughter in the house. And if you wont believe me, you can write to the school. We are one short here now, and we couldnt manage it at all, if one of our boys must go. And therefore I  had appeal to the County, for to look in the matter.The Tribunal of Aberayron has allowed two men Conditional Exemption to all the Farms in the neighbour, and they are smaller than us.

It seemed then, that the work could be completed by the first week in August.\nOne of the Masons, Evan Jones, was taken ill on the 23rd of May and has not been working since, and they have failed to get another mason to help them until this week, with the result that the house cannot be completed now until the middle of September.\nIf Mr J.W.Evans cannot be allowed to complete his part of the work it will be most difficult to find another man to replace him and finish the building.\nRichard E, Bevan.

The said Alun J Jones for whom I make this appeal is 19 years   of age and was granted temporary exemption till the end of this month by the Appeal tribunal at Lampeter held in May last. I cant think of carrying on this large farm if this boy is taken away.

Will you kindly let me know what steps he should take to have his appeal in order. The time is short and I shall feel greatly obliged if you will assist me in the matter. I intend coming to Aberystwyth on Tuesday, and shall be glad if you will grant me an interview for few munites at about 10,a.m. that day.

There are also 2 cows and a heifer, 7 sheep and a pony to be looked after. I am a widowed mother and he is the only son remaining at home to help in supporting me. One son is already in the army (active service) and another son is in the munition factory at Bury Port.

All the farm is cultivated in rotation, with the exception of 5 acres, of steep dingle. The soil mostly is heavy and wet, and laborious to work, consequently tillage is in a very backward state, owing to the lateness and severity of the season.

The rent is low because of the situation of the farm.\nI became a tenant of the farm at Michaelmas 1915 when it was arranged between me and my brother Thomas Thomas(the man in this case) that in consequence of my ill health he should remain in my service for a number of years until I had established myself.\nI have never been in good health and I am continually suffering from bronchitis and asthma which confine me to bed from time to time - My last attack recently laying me up for 3 weeks in bed. I annex Medical certificate.\nMy staff consists of :- \nMyself,\nThomas Thomas,\nJohn Davies(a lad of 16 years last birthday),\nMy Wife 27,\nHannah Jones aged 22,\nMary Evans aged 15.\nMy stock consists of :-\nHORSES :-  6 working 3 teams\n                     4 other\nCATTLE:-   16  Milch cows\n                    15 store\n                    10 calves\n                    100 ewes\n                     Pigs etc\nI have had ploughed 60 acres of land which is not seeded being 12 to 13 acres more than was under plough last year, but I have not ploughed any of this myself. I have 25 acres under hay. \nThe boundary of my farm extends to about 3 miles and it is fenced with barbed wire and the repair and maintenance of the fence requires much care attention and labour.\nThomas Thomas does all the reaping by machine, the thrashing by machine, hay-cutting by machine and I entrust the whole management to him as farm-bailiff - Thomas Thomas is therefore absolutely indispensable to me for carrying on the farm and a substitute could not fill his place.\nThomas Thomas also sells and buys at fairs and markets for me when I am prevented from doing so by illness.\nUnless I am permitted to retain Thomas Thomas' services I shall be obliged to realise my stock etc and give up my farm.\n\n<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberaeron Rural District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

DAVID EVANS of Alltwen, Ciliau Aeron Tailor  saith:- I have been examined by the Medical Board and classed C. 1. I am 29 years old and married. I commenced business on my own account 8 years ago  at Alltwen Ciliau Aeron. I have no workmen in my employ, but I have advertised for workmen and for apprentices but without avail. I am therefore fully occupied at my trade. I annex a list of my customers numbering 111, which shows I have a good business connection. My business is partly a credit one and I have debts of various amounts owing to me from customers. I have been granted a Certificate of Exemption twice by Aberayron (Rural) Local Tribunal the Members of which are well acquainted with the circumstances of my case. Being a country tailor my customers would have to go far from their homes to find other tailors if I were called up for service. I respectfully ask you to dismiss the Appeal for reasons before stated and particularly on the grounds 1. That I am the sole proprietor of a small business to which  the considerations mentioned by the Central Tribunal in R.100 Case No. 51 apply to which case attention is drawn in Memorandum R./24 under the heading \"Sole Proprietors of small businesses\" 2. That having been classed in category C.1. my case does not fall within the class of cases (Categories A and B) respecting men under 31 years of age.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberaeron Rural District<p>Number of Case: 1123R<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

Out of 10 horses, I have four brood mares in foal, that will leave me by the beginning of May with all my working horses under 3 years old, requiring a very competent man to manage them. Of other sotck, I have 13 Milch cows, 17 yearlings, 8 calves, 50 sheep, 62 lambs, and 14 pigs.\n\nI have been for years subject to severe attacks of lumbago, which renders me at times unable to move about without the aid of a stick or two. My wife too, has been subject to rheumatism for years, and is almost unable to move about.\n\nOf my 3 daughters, one is a dress maker, and knows but very little of farm work. The other two are in charge of all the house-hold activities, diary work, etc.\n\nOf my 3 sons, one is only a boy of 12, with only one arm, The other, although he is 17 years of age, is very slight and weak, and can not be trusted with a pair of young horses. It seems quite obvious therefore that it will be impossible for me to carry on the work of my farm, if my son David, being the only strong and competant man on the farm, is taken away. No substitute will ever do his work, as he is putting in very long hours every day.\n\nI am, Sir, respectfully yours, W.Evans\n\nApril 14th 1917.<p>Name of Tribunal: Aberaeron Rural District<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I am still willing to submit to such a condition. I have had some experience as a farm hand, a collier, and an engine driver. I may state however, that it is very important that I should be as near my home as possible, as my wife is in a certain condition at present.

(c) Owing to my advance age (64) and a weak chest. I am unable  to do any ploughing and all the ploughing and the care of the 4 horses is being carried out by Edward Davies, and if I am deprived of the services of Edward Davies, I shall have no alternative but to give up the farm, one half of which is arable land, or turn the arable land into pasture for which it is entirely unsuited.

I may also state that I do much business on the credit system, and that a large sum of money is now due to me. My wife, owing to continual ill health, is often unable to assist in the shop, so that if I am compelled to join the Army, I will have to do away with my business entirely, I will be unable to meet my creditors, and be landed in financial ruin.

If I lose his services, I shall be unable to carry on the work of the farm. I earnestly hope he will be starred.  6. Signature of Employer. David Evans.

I (his father) am over 70 years of age and carry on business in Llanon as a draper. I am unable to mange this business owing to being a sufferer from Bronchial Catarrh and the after results of Pneumonia. It is now entirely carried on by my son David, and if he must join the Service the business must be closed. Out of four sons three have joined the Army and are now serving in France and  Salonika. So I earnestly appeal to be allowed to retain the services of my fourth boy to keep the business open. If I and my wife could live without depending on the business I would willingly allow my fourth son to fight for his King and Country.
