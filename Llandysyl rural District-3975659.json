We base our reasons for petitioning on the following grounds:\n1. Two of his brothers are already in the army. \n2. His mother's health is in such a bad state at present that we consider it impossible for him to leave her now. He does all the housework for her, and she has nobody upon whom she can rely but him.\n3. Many of us being small holders, we will greatly miss the help of JONES during the forth coming harvest. The neighbouring farmer's being short of hands this year, we cannot expect any help from them as we used to, and we consider that it is not too much for us as small holders to have one person at least who can render us occasional help that is if his mother's health at the time will be in such a state as to be able to spare him from the house for a few hours now and again. \n\nName and address of Petitioner                                   Employment\nEliza & Letitia EVANS, Blainllebu                                    Small Holder\nGriffith DAVIES, Frongoch                                               Small Holder\nHannah JONES, Penlanbach                                          Small Farmer\nD G JAMES, Maesygelli                                                   Farmer\nO D DAVIES, Beulah                          Minister of the Capel & Small Holder\nDavid JONES, Ffosyrhendy                                             Farmer\nD MORRIS, Plasnewydd                                                  Small Farmer\nJohn D JONES, Plasnewyyd                                           Master Mariner<p>Name of Tribunal: Cardiganshire/Cardigan County<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

This young man's father is a cattle dealer living at Adpar\n2. He rents the farm at Parkau, 103 acres of which about 30 are ploughed annually\n3. Parkau Farm is worked by a married son, David John Rees and a lad of 15. Two of Mr Rees daughters also live there.\n4. Mr Rees keeps about 100 head of cattle on this farm and he alleges that his son Enoch is \"indispensable\" in looking after these animals\n5. Mr Rees' other married son George lives with his father at Adpar and, though a cattle dealer, he ought to be able to help at Parkau when  men are so urgently required for the army , even at the cost of some sacrifice to himself.\n6. The winter is over and the cattle will soon be out in the fields, labour in respect of them being therefore considerably reduced.\n7. It is absurd to suppose that a man with Mr Rees' means and position cannot obtain as a cattleman either (a) an unattested married man or (b) a man ineligible for the army or (c) a youth of 16 to 18. He has not advertised for (b) or (c) and by sending £3 to the Labour Exchange he can obtain a Dave [?] from 18 to 25 (vide Board of Agriculture's instructions.\n8. The attitude of the family towards recruiting is shown by the impertinence displayed to Mr Parry, the Derby Canvasser.\n9. Enoch Rees' time is not solely given to tending cattle.

I am the tenant of two farms, one in the parish of Cilrhedyn and the other in Llangunllo and the distance between the two is about 8 miles. Pentop farm Cilrhedyn is 50 acres in extent and Dolaucwerchyr Llangunllo is 51 acres or thereabouts. I am the only male hand on Pentop and my son Johnny REES the only male on Dolaucwerchyr. If my son Johnny REES is compelled to join the army the farm of Dolaucwerchyr would be left without a male hand to work it and would consequently run waste. It would be impossible for me to keep the two places going myself as I live 8 miles from Dolaucwerchyr. I have no other son capable of taking his place nor could I hope to find a substitute for him. If he is taken away the land would suffer and I would not be able to pay the rent. I keep a team of horses on each farm. The scale agreed betwen the Army Council and the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries provides that one man be kept for each team of horses.  <p>Previous applications: (a) March 6th 1916\n(b) By present applicant\n(c) Llandyssul Local Tribunal\n(d) Conditional exemption granted.

I shall endeavour to put the facts concisely in the following statements:-\n1. My father, who is 91 years of age, requires asistance in undressing and dressing. In the night he gets periodical attacks, which necessitate urgent attention, because he experiences a difficulty in breathing.\n2. My stepmother died last May, so now the only one to give loving attention and thoughtful care is my brother, whose work is a tailor at home, so father gets his direct attention and supervision constantly.\n3. My brother's wife does not live with him. Her health too is liable to nervous break-downs, and for obvious reasons she is not available and willing to undertake domestic duties.\n4. Father's age creates a natural difficulty in finding suitable lodgings, because it would be impossible to get anyone to give the essential attention and again it would be practically impossible to get anyone to undertake the responsibility at home without <p>Name of Tribunal: Llandysul Rural District<p>Number of Case: 865<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

My father has one son and six grandsons already serving in  the army, and I feel it would be a terrible burden for an old man at his age to break up a home now.\n7. I understand that my brother is medically unfit owing to heart trouble, as this additional fact emphasizes a favourable decision in this case\n\nI should like to express my most earnest appeal to the Tribunal to give a sympathetic consideration to this case, which, I can assure you , is most deserving, and I have every confidence that you will not consider this letter as obtrusive, but rather as an expression of filial attachment to a father whose last few years are an object of considerable anxiety to me, if existing conditions of living will be changed.\nI quite realize the difficulties, which the Tribunal has to content with, and I am far from advocating exemption on trivial grounds, but I feel that the circumstances which characterize this particular case, deserve your favourable decision.\nI am\nYours very respectfully and obediently\n[signed] T Ainsleigh Jones<p>Name of Tribunal: Llandysul Rural District<p>Number of Case: 865<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

It would be impossible to get suitable help as my father requires nursing attention day and night and since I am home I am able to for for him what paid services could not give, and at his age it would be cruel to break up his home and that he should seek lodgings.

It would be rather a great hard-ship on his part, because practically speaking he has opened up the whole connection in that district, as if he should be called up, and we have to take on a substitute it is quite possible that substitute would not undertake the work unless it was guarante regular. \nWe may also add we have the majority of our men called up and at the moment we do not know of anyone that would take on the LLANDYSSUL branch for us, however under the above circumstances and the fact that his wife is unable to carry on the branch. We trust you will give him several months exemption with leave to appeal again .\nThanking you for your consideration in the<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

The corn crops on this farm are thin and poor, and in consequence I have to plough up a much larger quantity of land than if the farm were situate in a more fertile portion of the country. The only people hitherto employed on the farm are myself (51 years of age) my wife (45 years of age) and my three children viz this man, my son David James JONES - 17 years of age and my daughter Sarah Anne JONES - 16 years of age - but my second son - D J JONES - will be leaving my service in November next, and afterwards this man - Thomas JONES - will be the only male employee left in my service and it will be impossible for me to carry on the farm without him, being advanced in years and suffering from rheumatism and a weak heart, and quite unable to remain in the barn whilst thrashing is going on. Even if I were to retain my second son at home, through being compelled to lose the services of my son Thomas JONES, I could never with the aid of my second son carry on the farm, as he - D J JONES - is not sufficiently strong and skilled to do the ploughing and attend to the machines and do the other heavy work on the farm. The nearest railway station to my farm is 8 miles off; my eldest son (John JONES) has already joined the Colours. <p>Signature of appellant: Edward JONES<p>Tag: Pink R43/R44: Page 1",

I myself am 64 years and on account of failing health I am not able to do any work now.

It is impossible to get on over winter and spring without him. I am 64 years of age and my health is in a precarious condition. I farm Troedrhiwffenyd which comprises about 80 acres and also a portion of 20 acres of the adjacent farm of Cwmmendwy. I generally have about 30 acres under corn and green crops. The farm is one of the most laborious in the district owing to its being so steep and hilly. Two teams of horses are constantly working if weather permits during the winter and spring and then it is a race against time to put in the seed. I have to cart the farmyard manure up in the winter and early spring months doing only 8 small loads per team per day and the field over 5 acres which comes under rotation for potatoes etc is exceptionally steep. Only one way I can plough most of the fields and the field I intend to plough up next year is no exception but I must curtail the land under cultivation if above man is not exempted.

The Tribunal did not take into consideration the facts that my farm is a large one and that I am a bachelor. It would be a matter of physical impossibility for me to carry on the work of this farm without the aid of at least one strong abel bodied young man. I myself am obliged to go away on business at times and it is essential that I should have a man who is capable of taking charge of the work in my absence. This man is in charge of all my machinery and is fully capable of attending to and taking charge of young horses and if I am not allowed to retain his services I really do not know how I could manage the farm. I have two teams of horses working regularly and according to appendix B of the latest list of certified occupations one skilled able bodied man is regarded as necessary for each team of horses. Before the commencement of the war I always had 2 able bodied men on the farm besides myself . Also in addition I had the assistance of my father (now deceased) who worked as cattleman.

I am nearly 34 years of age and am the only son of the  family.  I have one sister who is married with 4 children, the eldest of which is only 10 yrs of age.  She is suffering from an ulcerated leg for the last 10 yrs & is quite incapable  of giving me any assistance, as is shown by the Medical Certificate herewith.\nMy father is nearly 75 yrs of age and is suffering from Chronic Bronchitis and a serious rupture as per Certificate and he is quite unable to do any work of any kind or hardly move about.\nMy mother is 70 yrs of age and is of very weak mind and is being medically attended to, as per Medical Certificate herewith.  She was a few years  ago an inmate of the Carmarthen Mental Hospital owing to her mind being deranged through being disapointed [sic].  When we had her home we had to undertake to be watchful about her, as she is very apt to do harm herself. We have to be very tender towards her and have to take care not to dissapoint [sic] her in any way as the least thing is enough to upset her.\nI am the only means of support of my aged Parents in keeping the home going & should I be called up it would be a very serious hardship on them, and it would be enough to derange my Mother's mind again, and owing to her advanced age the probability is she would be beyond recovery.\nWhat then would be waiting me back but a motherless home and a broken hearted old father.  I'm sure if ever there was a case of \"Serious Domestic hardship\" that my case is a most deserving one.\nTrusting that you will consider my case from my standpoint and that you will grant me a Conditional exemption the same as the Local Tribunal being they knew the situation so well.<p>Name of Tribunal: Llandysul Rural District<p>Number of Case: -<p>Tag: Unknown document type",

I should be grateful for further advice in view of the following facts.\nEnclosed you will find a Certificate from Dr Lloyd, Lampeter whom I was advised to consult by the Medical Board at Carmarthen.  In view of enclosed Certificate I take it that it will not be necessary for me to attend the Tribunal and would mean a great saving for me as it is very inconvenient & expensive to go from here to Lampeter.\nI should be very grateful if you would let me know by return of post if you consider it advisable for me to be present hoping it will not be necessary.  I have applied for admission to Sanatorium.\nI remain yours\nJ.R.Davies\nP.S.

The Chairman of \"The Cardiganshire Appeal Tribunal\"\nSir\nOn behalf of my neighbour - Mr Dd Powell of Closygraig, Glanarthen I beg to make the following observations which may prove helpful to enable the Tribunal to decide his case.\nHe was brought up from childhood on a farm and is consequently fully acquainted with all agricultural operations.\nAfter leaving school he was employed for many years as a farmhand at various large  farms in this locality, becoming i due course \"horseman\" and \"ploughman\" and taking charge if all the ordinary machines used in farm-work.\nSince learning his vocation of country mason at the age of 19, he has at times left the building trade altogether and returned to his employment as farm-servant often for months together, and invariably every year during the hay and corn harvests, this being a special conditions of the tenancy of the holding which he has occupied for over 7 years.  In compliance with the instructions of the Local Tribunal at their meeting when his case was dealt with he has been working full time upon local farms where his services are in constant demand owing to the great dearth of experienced far-hands.In conclusion I most strongly recommend him as a most suitable person whose services should be returned in agriculture.\nYours truly,\nDavid O.

I was directed to point out to you that this Committee was of opinion that the closing of this establishment would cause serious dislocation of business in the locality and grave inconvenience to his customers.

Since my husband's death, which took place two months after the outbreak of war, the sole management of the Gomerian Press printing office has been under the direction of my son David LEWIS, who also serves as a printer, and in respect of whom this application is made. The number of persons originally employed at the Office was 6; two of whom are now serving with H M Forces - viz my son Rhys LEWIS who is in the Royal Naval Division and Albert BAILEY who is at the front serving with the Kings Roal Rifles, and another of my employees has left to relieve a man for Military Service. Every effort has been made to replace these men but without success. So it is evident that we are already seriously understaffed and have experienced great difficulties. The Gomerian Press office was established over 25 years ago and up to the present moment has supplied an area covering 15 miles radium with almost the whole of the printing required.

Since his death I carried on the business myself and just now I have a young nephew of mine, a lad of 14 years of age, as apprentice. I am the only Tailor in the neighbourhood, the nearest tailor in one direction being 3 1/2 miles away, the nearest in the every other direction being 4 1/2 miles away. I do work for about 80 farms and about an equal number of cottagers. I have in stock material to the value of about £100 and my customers owe me something like £200. My late father bequeathed me the house and shop in which I live to carry on the business on condition that I bought up my young nephew and providing him with a home. clothing etc untill he is 21 years of age. Further I have to teach him in the tailoring trade free of charge. Were I called up I should have to break up my home and dispose of my business that of course would be financial ruin to me. I have being examined by the medical board and placed me in class C3 only. \nRe Question 7\nSoon after the military service act came into force my later father appealed for me to the Llandyssul Rural Tribunal and I was granted condition exemption in Oct 1916. 3 months after my father's death the Military Representative called my case up for review again the Local Tribunal granted me conditional exemption. The Military Representative appeal against their decision and the appeal tribunal granted me 3 months and a right to appeal in February last. My appeal was again considered by the Appeal Tribunal and I was granted a further exemption of 3 months with right of appeal. <p>Tag: Unknown document type",

Up to about 12 years ago I was working as a Mason, at Glamorganshire and other places, but on account of failing health I had to give up that work and come home to Horeb. I would never have given up my trade were it not for the benefit of my health. I was able to earn about three times as much in my trade as I did when employed by my mother. Since I have come home we have increased the business and we now regularly send away each week about 6000 eggs, and also about 150 fowls. I regularly attend the markets at Carmarthen and Newcastle Emlyn. If I were compelled to join the army the whole business would collapse, which would be a serious hardship upon me and my family.

I am and have for several years beein in rather a feeble state of health and consequently I am dependent to a very large extent upon my foreman and manager. This employee has been in my employ for over 20 years and now knows how to carry on the business quite as well as myself. I entrust him not only the supervision of the shop and the other employees but also the work of buying and taking charge of all the cash connected with the business. Being obliged under medical advice to spend months in the course of every year at various health resorts I could not possibly carry on my business without the aid of a competent foremen and manager. If therefore I were to lose this employee I would be obliged to close my business premises and discharge all my other employees. <p>Signature: David JONES<p>Date: 1916-05-09T15:02:07.000Z<p>Tag: Blue R52/53, page 2",
