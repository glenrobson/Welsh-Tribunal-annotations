If he is taken away I have no other alternative but to sell up my two horses and the two cows and allow the land to grow wild and to be uncultivated. As I asked before in my former application on Form R13 the aforesaid Johnny Davies and one housemaid are the only employees in my service. He is in full charge of the farm, doing anything necessary on it throughout the year. The horses, cows pigs and poultry are also under his sole care. He is also in charge of the garden. Including all I can assure you he is fully employed and his services are therefore absolutely necessary for me. I may add that I could not secure the services of anyone anywhere in the locality to replace him because of the scarcity of farm labour in the district and I therefore earnestly appeal for the exemption of the said Johnny Davies.<p>Signature: Jno[?] Thomas<p>Address: Vrondolay New Quay<p>Occupation, profession or business: gentleman<p>Date of application: 1916-02-15T18:03:18.000Z<p>Decision of the Tribunal: Appeal refused\n\nE.J.

Johnny Davies of Vrondolay New Quay, Farm Servant, not attested.<p>Transcription: I appeal on the grounds that I feel that my case has been unjustly considered by the Local Tribunal for reasons already submitted which are - \n1. I hold 41 acres more or less of land, 26 acres of which are grazing land which I rent. \n2. My arable land is about 4 or 5 acres more or less and to take my servant man away immediately will mean that this land will have to remain 12 months at least uncultivated, and so far I have NO prospects to secure any reliable farm hand to replace him. I cannot do anything myself - not brought up to it.\n3. I have 2 horses, 2 colts the Carter are not in also 2 cows/calf and calf daily expected. It will not be easy to sell any of these at a moment's notice if my man is taken away immediately. My man is in sole charge of the above animals and of the farm. I asked for his exemption on the above grounds. If this is not justified from your point of view give me 2 months extension of time for me to set and sow the land or 6 weeks to dispense with or sell all of my animals and the land can remain in fallow.<p>Name of Tribunal: Cardiganshire/Cardigan County<p>Number of Case: None<p>Tag: Unknown document type",
